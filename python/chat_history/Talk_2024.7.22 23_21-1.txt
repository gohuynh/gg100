Mar 18, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gordon : Never, it was always painful
Mar 18, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gordon : Maybe the first meal was good
Mar 18, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gordon : But the second one was never fun
Mar 18, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gordon : He just likes making us do dumb things

Mar 20, 2024 at 7:14 PM, Gordon : Hey! I told you, I only got uncool after that
Mar 20, 2024 at 7:14 PM, Gracy : why you are so kind to me 🥺 now you make me wanna cry
Mar 20, 2024 at 7:15 PM, Gracy : I don't believe you
Mar 20, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gordon : Because I like you a lot, but maybe, can we make a deal? No pressure though, ok? You can say no, and it doesn’t change anything
Mar 20, 2024 at 7:18 PM, Gordon : You don’t have to worry about the trip, but I get to tell people that the awesome Gracy is my girlfriend… is that ok?
Mar 20, 2024 at 7:20 PM, Gracy : I wanna say yes to that but don't you wanna ask that after we meet? Maybe you might wanna take that back...

Mar 24, 2024 at 11:51 PM, Gordon : Yes please!!!
Mar 24, 2024 at 11:52 PM, Gracy : Rat Demon
Appearance: A demon with the face of a rat and a human body. However, those who have seen the true form of the Rat Demon are now dead and gone.
Personality: The Rat Demon has no guilt for killing humans. He is selfish and wicked. Usually, he acts like he has mastered everything and does not care about anything. But there are moments when he becomes arrogant and suddenly aggressive. In truth, this behavior is a defense mechanism to hide the true nature of a rat that causes him to have low self-esteem.
Background: In the past, the Rat Demon was once an ordinary mouse. Perhaps he was suffering from hunger for a long time. However, his memories of that time were hazy. But for sure he knows it was a life he never wants to go back to. 
On the day when the White Fox's mother died in the forest close to the capital city, a mouse living in the countryside far away from the capital city ate nails that a nobleman threw away. That was the moment when the Rat Demon clearly remembers.
An unknown power pumped through his veins, his bones shattered and reformed, and his muscles expanded. The ordinary mouse transformed into the nobleman whose nail he ate. Right after the body modification, the nobleman's memories and emotions flooded into him. The sensational experience of all the emotions and memories a human had felt throughout his lifetime at once was overwhelming but unforgettable. As if his entire body was shaking, and his brain was about to explode. The Rat Demon didn't understand what had turned an ordinary mouse into a demon, but he was never able to forget this moment. In the memories of the nobleman, he ate the warm bowls of rice, slept in a cozy bed, and had loving parents. The Rat Demon envied him deeply. Instead of being a hungry mouse, he wanted to be a nobleman in warmth and abundance so badly. So, when the nobleman who looked exactly like himself came outside of the village, one day, the Rat Demon spied on him and killed him. He was afraid that someone might discover he was a fake, so the Rat Demon ate every last bit of the dead nobleman, down to a single strand of hair. Then he returned to the nobleman's home and lived as him. Finally, he felt complete. 
Ironically, for several months, the Rat Demon now found the nobleman's life tedious. He was bored and desired to experience a new human life. He was hungry again. So, he killed and ate several more humans, living their lives one after the other. Of course, to avoid discovery, he ate the whole body every time. The Rat Demon lived as a butcher, as the wife of a blacksmith, and even as the magistrate of a small town. As he repeated murders, the Rat Demon became addicted to the thrill of stealing human emotions and memories. Murder became crafty and entertaining. Over time, his awareness that he is just a small rat and fear that someone might discover his true nature faded away, and he lost count of how many humans he ate. 
However, the Rat Demon was still suffering from unstoppable hunger and hollowness. So, as he sees the landscape of a small village in the countryside. he thought, "I need to eat something bigger." That day, for the very first time, the Rat Demon did not eat the dead body and left it as it was killed except for the nails.

Mar 24, 2024 at 11:52 PM, Gracy : This is one of the character,

Mar 24, 2024 at 11:56 PM, Gordon : Hehe, it’s a good inspiration 
Mar 24, 2024 at 11:57 PM, Gordon : But the rat demon sounds like a very interesting character to learn his backstory slowly 
Mar 24, 2024 at 11:57 PM, Gracy : Yup yup, Rat Demon is a hidden villain. just to add one explanation, the white fox is a symbol of revelation. on the day the King saw the white fox in the forest, the prince was born, so the king always hated his son cuz he thought his son would kill him one day for the crown. 
Mar 24, 2024 at 11:57 PM, Gordon : Are you saving him for your first game?
Mar 24, 2024 at 11:58 PM, Gracy : But in truth, Rat Demon also became the Demon on the day King saw the white fox, so actually Rat  Demon was who will going to kill the king
Mar 24, 2024 at 11:58 PM, Gracy : Maybe….? but I am not sure I can make this story into real game, ㅋㅋㅋ  this is too complicated game

Mar 26, 2024 at 6:05 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I think monkey is not the correct term to use it
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:05 PM, Gracy : You makes freaking program
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:07 PM, Gordon : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:07 PM, Gracy : do you do coding?
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:08 PM, Gordon : Technically I do coding
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:08 PM, Gracy : tell me more abt your work?
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:08 PM, Gordon : But in real work, most coders actually only do coding for maybe 20% of their time
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:08 PM, Gordon : As you command
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:08 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:08 PM, Gracy : and other 80% are?
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:09 PM, Gordon : Ummm, a lot of work in coding is actually writing or talking
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:09 PM, Gordon : Meetings are maybe 40% of time
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:09 PM, Gordon : Because there are lots of teams working with each other, you need meetings to make sure nobody is lost
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:09 PM, Gracy : I see
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:10 PM, Gordon : Or sometimes you want people to look at your work and make sure it’s ok with them
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:10 PM, Gordon : The last 40% is writing about what you’re going to do so people can review it
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:11 PM, Gordon : Or write about what you did, so in the future if someone needs to fix what you did, they have an idea of what it’s suppose to do
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:11 PM, Gracy : Did I tell you I worked in the home page creating company before Mason?
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:12 PM, Gordon : No! Is that the same marketing company? Or different one?
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:12 PM, Gracy : different one
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:12 PM, Gordon : How was that?
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:13 PM, Gracy : It was a short period of time cuz it was start-up company and CEO of the company was my friend and she want me to help her out before I get a real job
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:14 PM, Gracy : And my role was basically to communicate between, clients, web designers, developers, and publishers. 
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:15 PM, Gracy : So I had to take care of this
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:16 PM, Gordon : Yeah, those people organizing it always are so busy
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:17 PM, Gordon : Gracy is so strong… can definitely kick my butt…
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:17 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ it was fun to work
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:18 PM, Gracy : CEO was my friend so I bought what ever I wanted to eat in the office with the company money
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:18 PM, Gracy : And also it was fun to work with different people in different fields
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:26 PM, Gordon : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ

Mar 26, 2024 at 6:27 PM, Gordon : A lot of work, but still fun

Mar 26, 2024 at 6:29 PM, Gordon : Maybe, will it hurt my feelings?
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:30 PM, Gracy : I am not sure
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:30 PM, Gracy : According to my experiences, just one case in my company
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:31 PM, Gracy : engineers were the hardest to communicate with cuz they were the ones who always said no
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:33 PM, Gordon : Uh ohhhh
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:33 PM, Gordon : We do say no a lot to our designer…
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:33 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Mar 26, 2024 at 6:34 PM, Gracy : so it was my job to mediate that

Mar 27, 2024 at 5:24 PM, Gracy : Emoticons But I found it! don't worry ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ thank you so much for trying to helping me 
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:26 PM, Gordon : Emoticons 
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gordon : My brain is too old and slow :(
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋme too
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gracy : So I aksed to google
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gordon : What game did you decide to do?
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gracy : I am thinking between
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gracy : two truth and one lie
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gracy : this is simple quick
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:27 PM, Gracy : but not …. sure… if I can make them lie cuz it is happening in church
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:28 PM, Gracy : the other is [Name that Person]
Each person writes three interesting facts about themselves and puts them into a pile with the rest of their group. And they pick one, and have to guess who that is
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:29 PM, Gordon : Oh, those are good!
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:30 PM, Gordon : What a great company!
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:30 PM, Gracy : Yea, google gave me good one
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:30 PM, Gracy : whoever works there must be so cool
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:30 PM, Gordon : Photo
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:31 PM, Gordon : I was trying to remember a game like this
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:31 PM, Gordon : The idea is everyone says 1 fun fact about themselves
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:31 PM, Gordon : Then going in a circle or something, you have to remember who said which fun fact
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:31 PM, Gordon : And you try to name everybody
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:32 PM, Gracy : That sounds fun  too!
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:32 PM, Gordon : I think it was person A says a fun fact
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:33 PM, Gordon : Then person B says person A’s fun fact and then their own fun fact
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:33 PM, Gordon : C says A, B, then C
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:33 PM, Gracy : But
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:33 PM, Gordon : And it goes all the way back to person A to say it all over again to “win”
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:34 PM, Gracy : if A already said fun facts about B and C. Like they already know the answers right?
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:34 PM, Gordon : Yeah, but it’s kinda a memory test
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:34 PM, Gracy : Ohh I sea what you mean
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:34 PM, Gordon : Bc by person like J, they have to remember everything before
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:35 PM, Gracy : I am not sure if it is in Eng. too but we have game called when you go to the school
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:35 PM, Gracy : basically you name things in school in circle until someone forgot the order
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:36 PM, Gordon : What is the order?
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:36 PM, Gracy : Like I say pencil, you say pencil and paper, and Bebe says pencil and paper and notebook
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:36 PM, Gordon : Ohhhhh
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:36 PM, Gordon : Then yes! Like that!
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:36 PM, Gordon : I remember it being funny afterwards
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:36 PM, Gordon : Bc everybody ends up knowing person A’s fun fact really well
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:36 PM, Gracy : hahaha
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:37 PM, Gordon : I forgot what happens if someone makes a mistake
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:37 PM, Gracy : well I think it is good game to play if you want to make A popular in the school
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:37 PM, Gracy : get smacked?
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:37 PM, Gordon : Maybe… could be… probably…

Mar 27, 2024 at 5:38 PM, Gordon : Ohhh, they might to go to the end of the line
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:38 PM, Gracy : Oh okay
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:38 PM, Gordon : It might be a long game if there’s a lot of people
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:39 PM, Gracy : It sounds like it lol
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:40 PM, Gordon : This one sounded good too
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:40 PM, Gordon : Maybe split the group into teams, so it’s less people to guess from?
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:40 PM, Gracy : yup we will split them into groups
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:41 PM, Gordon : Ahh makes sense
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:41 PM, Gordon : Emoticons 
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:41 PM, Gordon : This just reminds me of old ice breakers
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:41 PM, Gordon : And the anxiety

Mar 27, 2024 at 5:43 PM, Gordon : I believe in you!!
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:43 PM, Gordon : Emoticons 
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:44 PM, Gordon : Are you going to be the main person leading?
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:44 PM, Gracy : I have another person who is doing  this with me
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:44 PM, Gracy : but we haven't decided whos the main

Mar 27, 2024 at 5:45 PM, Gordon : Maybe you can use your president power and make her do it
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:49 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:49 PM, Gracy : my presidential power is not effective over there yet
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:50 PM, Gordon : What?!?
Mar 27, 2024 at 5:50 PM, Gordon : Do i need to start a war for you?

Mar 31, 2024 at 11:57 PM, Gracy : When I talked to you, I thought you were a very firm person inside. I believe you can be nice to other people when you are sure about yourself inside and you are strong inside. Remember how you tried to comfort me when I had a mental breaking down when I had a car accident or sent the money to the wrong person? So I want you to stop saying you are weak cuz you seem a pretty strong person to me! I can not take you saying bad things about Gordon I know

Our brave heroes consist of Sir Brie, the valiant knight with a lactose intolerance; Gouda, the adventurous halfling bard with a penchant for cheesy puns; Mozzarella, the stoic elven ranger who's always on the lookout for new flavors; and Feta, the mischievous gnome wizard who's a little too obsessed with dairy magic.

Apr 4, 2024 at 10:04 PM, Gracy : 1) Taking a taxi from Incheon Airport to your housing on your arrival date:

Upon completing the entry processes at Incheon Airport, you can easily find taxis at the airport. In case you need assistance, feel free to ask any staff member, and they will help you find a taxi. Please show the following message to the taxi driver, which contains your address. If the driver has any questions, they can contact me using my phone number provided below. While most international credit cards should work, I recommend having some cash in Korean Won (about 100,000 KRW, which is approximately 100 USD) as a precaution.

Apr 8, 2024 at 1:14 AM, Gracy : *He bit through the power lines and took out power on campus prior to a men’s basketball conference championship game against our biggest rival. The game ended up getting pushed to the following day because of it, so they drove out for no reason

When “sparky” was found he immediately became a campus celebrity, with students surrounding him with acorns and flowers. This continued on for years, with him even being mention in the inauguration of the university’s president, and memorial acorns handed out at 2018’s graduation.

Apr 11, 2024 at 7:10 PM, Gracy : 1) Taking a taxi from Incheon Airport to your housing on your arrival date:
Upon completing the entry processes at Incheon Airport, you can easily find taxis at the airport. In case you need assistance, feel free to ask any staff member, and they will help you find a taxi. Please show the following message to the taxi driver, which contains your address. If the driver has any questions, they can contact me using my phone number provided below. While most international credit cards should work, I recommend having some cash in Korean Won (about 100,000 KRW, which is approximately 100 USD) as a precaution.

Apr 14, 2024 at 11:14 PM, Gracy : if you order stuff onine
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:14 PM, Gordon : but it won't be a big red box?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:14 PM, Gracy : you need a big red box?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:14 PM, Gordon : yeah, to match the nightstands
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gracy : okay
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gracy : we will find the big red box together!
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:16 PM, Gordon : hehehe
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:16 PM, Gordon : are you just saying that?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:16 PM, Gracy : no!
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:16 PM, Gracy : I want to find you a matching night stand, aka box
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gordon : what if we get matching boxes?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gordon : huh?

Apr 14, 2024 at 11:19 PM, Gordon : mhmm
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:19 PM, Gracy : sounds great! :)
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:19 PM, Gracy : so cute!
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:20 PM, Gracy : but I might not have enough luggage space to bring it back to Korea, so I might just keep it in your house. I don't think I can fit a box in my luggage.
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:20 PM, Gordon : Photo
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:21 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:21 PM, Gordon : Sounds awfully convenient huh?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:21 PM, Gracy : what do you mean?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:21 PM, Gracy : I understand no english
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:21 PM, Gordon : Huh??

Apr 14, 2024 at 11:22 PM, Gracy : 안녕
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:22 PM, Gordon : 닭
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:22 PM, Gracy : 닭 맛있지
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gordon : Ok, you got me
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gracy : 네?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:24 PM, Gordon : 예
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:24 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:26 PM, Gordon : 그 아기의 우유
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:26 PM, Gracy : ??????
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:26 PM, Gordon : Did I do that right?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:26 PM, Gracy : Emoticons 
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gracy : what do you wanna say?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gordon : Uh oh…
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gordon : The baby’s milk
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gracy : you are right then
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gracy : I thought it is so random
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gordon : Yeah, I know
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gordon : I’m not working with a lot of words yet
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:27 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:28 PM, Gracy : did you write by making the combination of words you used?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:28 PM, Gracy : *you learned?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:30 PM, Gracy : 예 is very formal and text book way to say yes
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:30 PM, Gracy : you can say 응 in casual way to friends
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:30 PM, Gracy : not to older person
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:30 PM, Gordon : 까마귀의 알 똔는 닭의 알
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:30 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ you are so cuteeee
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:30 PM, Gracy : 까마귀의 알 *또는 닭의 알
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:30 PM, Gracy : in Korean, you can skip saying 's
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:31 PM, Gordon : Ahhh, i pressed too many times
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:31 PM, Gordon : Kinda
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:31 PM, Gordon : Wait, really?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:31 PM, Gracy : so it sounds more natural to say
까마귀*알 또는 닭*알
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:31 PM, Gracy : it is still right
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:31 PM, Gordon : Is duolingo trying to teach me to speak like an old person?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:32 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋno it is different that you know 의 and skipping it on purpose and you doesn't know at all
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:32 PM, Gracy : just one more thing, 닭(의)알
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:33 PM, Gracy : changes to 달걀 (due to the pronounciation) 
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:33 PM, Gracy : so 달걀 = chicken engg
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:33 PM, Gracy : egg
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:33 PM, Gordon : Is it just for chicken egg?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:33 PM, Gracy : yup yup
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:33 PM, Gordon : Also, is 밝 a word?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:34 PM, Gordon : Duolingo keeps making me remember this
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:34 PM, Gracy : 닭알 still makes sense but it sounds like you are talking about chicken's egg and 달걀 is like you are speaking chicken's egg for food ingredients. You know like cow and beef
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:34 PM, Gracy : ?? just 밝?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:34 PM, Gordon : Yeah, I don’t get it either
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:35 PM, Gracy : can you capture the page?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:35 PM, Gordon : It was teaching me like 각, 갑, 갔
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:35 PM, Gordon : And would throw in 밝
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:35 PM, Gracy : Oh, I think they are giving you like random word
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:35 PM, Gordon : And I was confused why that ㄹ is in there
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:36 PM, Gracy : to see you if you can read hangul and to practice your pronounciation
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:36 PM, Gordon : It’s weird though, because all I hear from it is 박
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:36 PM, Gracy : oh, so we have something called double consonants and double vowels.
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:36 PM, Gracy : oooh.. I need screen sharing to explain this to you
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:36 PM, Gracy : but let me try
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:37 PM, Gracy : so remember when ㅘ sounds like ㅗ+ㅏ?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:37 PM, Gordon : Yes!
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:37 PM, Gracy : can you try to pronoucne rk at the same time?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:38 PM, Gracy : you will realize that you can only pronounce k only
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:38 PM, Gordon : Is it kinda like “lk” in milk?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:38 PM, Gracy : or rg?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:39 PM, Gracy : yea kinda
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:39 PM, Gracy : then you might ask
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:40 PM, Gracy : we can just write down 박 instead of 밝
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:40 PM, Gracy : why we need 밝
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:40 PM, Gracy : that have to go into deep in the Korean gramma
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:40 PM, Gordon : Oh, lol, so a lesson in the future?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:40 PM, Gracy : nono
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:40 PM, Gracy : I am telling you now
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:41 PM, Gordon : Yes professor
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:41 PM, Gracy : so in korean bottom consonent is called 받침 batchim
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:41 PM, Gracy : 감 = ㅁ is 받침
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:42 PM, Gracy : and 받침 effects the sounds of the letter that comes next
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:42 PM, Gracy : especially ㅇ and ㅎ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:42 PM, Gracy : so, if I say 가이 = Ga i
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gracy : but if I say 감이. ㅁ from the 감 moves up to the 이. so it sounds like Ga Mi
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gracy : do you understand?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gordon : mhmmm
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gordon : that make sense
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:43 PM, Gracy : so when I say 박
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:44 PM, Gracy : 박이
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:44 PM, Gracy : it is Bak i
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:44 PM, Gracy : but when I say 밝이
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:44 PM, Gracy : ㄱ in 밝 and 이 from ㅇ mixed up together and it becomes
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:45 PM, Gracy : 밝이 = 발끼 = Bal Ggi
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:45 PM, Gordon : That’s why 갇 닸 and 닽 all sound the same by themselves, but different when next to a different syllable?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:45 PM, Gracy : Yes! you are genious@
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:45 PM, Gordon : Only thanks to my professor
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:46 PM, Gracy : Photo
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:46 PM, Gracy : but merely different, cuz ㄷ/ㅆ/ㅌ is in the same pronunciation group in the table
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:48 PM, Gracy : but you really do not have to memorize the rule, you will get it naturally, I mean Gad, Gat, Gatt all sounds same even if I write them down in english right? (If you pronounce a as ah)
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:48 PM, Gordon : Very helpful!
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:48 PM, Gordon : Yes professor
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:48 PM, Gracy : Emoticons

Apr 14, 2024 at 11:49 PM, Gordon : Are you going to take my kidney?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:49 PM, Gracy : here this site might explain better about 받침.
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:49 PM, Gracy : what? know@
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gordon : Both my kidneys?!?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gracy : hey! know
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gracy : ?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gracy : why I am keep saying know instead of no
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gracy : what is wrong with my english
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gracy : no!
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:50 PM, Gordon : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:51 PM, Gordon : I still know what you meant
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:51 PM, Gracy : fancy experience in hotel Gordon might be paying the bill
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:51 PM, Gordon : What makes it fancy?
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:51 PM, Gracy : Read this site! It explains really well
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:51 PM, Gordon : Yes professor!
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:51 PM, Gracy : a big red box night stand
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:58 PM, Gordon : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:58 PM, Gordon : Then hotel Gordon will be super fancy for Gracy in return for the lessons
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:59 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:59 PM, Gordon : Oh, 1 more question
Apr 14, 2024 at 11:59 PM, Gordon : If that’s ok professor?

Monday, April 15, 2024
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:00 AM, Gracy : sure!
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:00 AM, Gracy : you are luping my office time so well
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:03 AM, Gordon : Ok, duolingo is teaching me 블락하고 하이브 as black and white
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:03 AM, Gordon : Are they just being lazy and teaching me loan words again?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:03 AM, Gracy : 블랙하고 화이트
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:03 AM, Gracy : what do you mean loa words?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:04 AM, Gordon : (I added the 하고)
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:04 AM, Gordon : Is it really just “beulak” ~ black
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:05 AM, Gordon : And “haiteu” ~ white
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:12 AM, Gracy : good good
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:12 AM, Gracy : you can not skip 하고
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:12 AM, Gracy : so it is 블랙하고 화이트하고
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:13 AM, Gracy : *블랙하고 화이트
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:13 AM, Gracy : 고든하고 예은이
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:14 AM, Gordon : And are those two the actual words for black and white?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:14 AM, Gracy : yes!
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:14 AM, Gracy : but if you wanna say pure korean
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:14 AM, Gracy : you can say
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:14 AM, Gracy : 검정하고 하얀색
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:15 AM, Gracy : 검정하고 하양
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:15 AM, Gordon : Is it more common to say the other way?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:15 AM, Gracy : we just say black and white a lot too like 블랙 화이트 but in Korean black is 검정  white is 하양
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:16 AM, Gracy : depends… but ppl will understand fine either way
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:16 AM, Gracy : I think we say 블랙 화이트 more often when we talk about product colour. like I got 블랙 shirts
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:17 AM, Gracy : but we say 검정 and 하양 with others like when I found out I failed my test, my vision became 검정
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:18 AM, Gordon : It just feels like 열쉬 또극 키
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:18 AM, Gordon : Okok
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:18 AM, Gracy : ????
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:18 AM, Gracy : can you try to write down again?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:19 AM, Gordon : I like using 블락 anyways

Apr 15, 2024 at 12:20 AM, Gracy : 굿!
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:21 AM, Gordon : I keep switching ㄱ and ㄴ

Apr 15, 2024 at 12:22 AM, Gracy : Emoticons 
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:22 AM, Gordon : No, a smart person wouldn’t struggle so much..
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:22 AM, Gracy : what do you mean!
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:23 AM, Gracy : its been less then a month you started Korean
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:23 AM, Gracy : and you are doing so good
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:23 AM, Gordon : You’re just being a nice teacher
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:24 AM, Gordon : I feel like i’m in elementary school again
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:24 AM, Gordon : Ehhh, maybe middle school actually
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:25 AM, Gracy : why middle school?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:26 AM, Gordon : Middle school is where I learned proper grammar
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:26 AM, Gordon : And started memorizing more words
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:27 AM, Gracy : Oh I see I see
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:27 AM, Gracy : but are you enjoying learning it?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:27 AM, Gordon : Yeah, the alphabet is very interesting
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:28 AM, Gordon : But I do feel like i’m in school again trying to memorize words
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:28 AM, Gracy : haha don't worry about the words too much
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:30 AM, Gracy : Emoticons You can get it naturally by getting exposed to Korean little by little if you plan to hang around with me for the long term.
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:30 AM, Gordon : I hope I get to hang around you for the long term!
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:31 AM, Gracy : you do?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:31 AM, Gordon : But what about you?! You might have a bf who knows the same amount of Korean as a 4 year old?!?
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:32 AM, Gracy : but you might have gf who knows the same amount of English as a 13ys old??
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:33 AM, Gordon : I think 13 is way better than 4
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:33 AM, Gordon : AND you know better than a 13 year old
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:33 AM, Gordon : You could be college level
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:34 AM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ I give credit to chat gpt
Apr 15, 2024 at 12:34 AM, Gordon : I’ve had TAs way harder to understand

You are one of the nicest people I have ever known in my life and I am so lucky to know you. Will you be nice to me all the time in the future too..? 👉👈 I am so excited about the future we will have fun together.

Apr 15, 2024 at 9:14 PM, Gordon : Emoticons 
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:15 PM, Gordon : Of course Gracy!! You’re one of the first people I’ve ever met where I feel like I can completely relax with and just be comfortable. And you make me feel so much more confident in who I am. So I’ll always be nice to you as long as you’ll let me hang out with you
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:17 PM, Gracy : Emoticons 
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:18 PM, Gordon : Everything ok Gracy?
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:19 PM, Gracy : yea! I am just touched what you said
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:20 PM, Gordon : I know we've only known each other for only a month and a half, but I don't think I've ever gotten along with someone so well and so quickly
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:21 PM, Gordon : So, that's why i'm super glad to have gotten to know Gracy and get to be with her so much when we can
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:24 PM, Gracy : I think it is crazy and a bit scary that we get to know each other too fast and what if it runs out too fast too. 
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:27 PM, Gracy : But also at the same time, I feel like this could work out if it is with you. cuz you seem like consistent and considerate people who treat relationships with others seriously. 
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:29 PM, Gordon : I'm happy you think that way, because I'm always scared of annoying or making people mad
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:30 PM, Gordon : And I know what you mean with this, but I also think it's a good sign that we're both worried about this
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:30 PM, Gordon : I think the people who get in trouble when rushing things are like romeo and juliet and don't really notice how fast things are moving
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:33 PM, Gracy : yea.. I know what you mean, you better not take my defuse next time
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:33 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋ

Apr 15, 2024 at 9:33 PM, Gracy : you are right, thank you for pointing out this. I agree with you it is a good sign
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:38 PM, Gordon : And anytime you don’t feel comfortable, let me know ok? I don’t have much experience in romance, so i’m going to mess up. I say this a lot to you, but you can remind me that we have plenty of time for us to figure things out
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:38 PM, Gordon : No need to rush things either
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:39 PM, Gracy : okay!
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:39 PM, Gracy : Thank you for saying that
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:39 PM, Gracy : but I wanna rush

Apr 15, 2024 at 9:44 PM, Gordon : Anyways this is talk we should have face to face 😁. Thank you for bringing this up though. Makes me feel more confident that I’m doing something right
Apr 15, 2024 at 9:44 PM, Gracy : where is that store huh? let me buy them all at once

Apr 15, 2024 at 10:37 PM, Gordon : I wish Gracy gets plenty of sleep and doesn't do a crazy schedule!
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:38 PM, Gracy : oopse
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:38 PM, Gracy : your wish conflicts with your other wish you made earlier.
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:38 PM, Gracy : Under the law of FIFO, your first wish will come true
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:39 PM, Gordon : woah, you know FIFO?
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:39 PM, Gracy : are you impressed with that? ㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:40 PM, Gordon : I am!
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:40 PM, Gordon : I thought it was mostly used in coding context
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:40 PM, Gracy : oh really?
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:40 PM, Gordon : how did you learn it?
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:40 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:40 PM, Gracy : I learnt when I took hospitalization in highschool
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:41 PM, Gracy : nope sowi I am wrong
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:42 PM, Gracy : I meant hospitality
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:43 PM, Gordon : haha
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:43 PM, Gordon : woah, you have that as a class?
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:43 PM, Gordon : what do you learn in it?
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:43 PM, Gracy : You learn about cook!
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:44 PM, Gracy : I learned about FIFO in terms of managing resources and hygiene in the kitchen
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:45 PM, Gracy : I even had a chef gown with my name on it
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:45 PM, Gordon : Cute!!!
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:45 PM, Gordon : Do you still have the gown?
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:45 PM, Gracy : Yup, In my parents house 
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:46 PM, Gordon : So I guess you're head chef Gracy too
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:46 PM, Gordon : What was your favorite thing you learned from that class?
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:47 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:47 PM, Gracy : I forgot most of the stuff but I learned how to be organized in the kitchen
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:49 PM, Gracy : so every week we had a theme, for example, if the topic was a scone, during the lecture we learned about all the history of scones, nutritional facts about it, and all the theoretic parts
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:52 PM, Gracy : (I forgot most of those partsㅋㅋㅋ) then we have a cooking class once a week. So we actually bake scones. Before we bake we have to write down (I forgot what it called) but basically, on the form, we have to write down what ingredients we need and what action we should take in order. For example, 1) take out mixing bowls. 2) measure all the ingredients....


Apr 15, 2024 at 10:52 PM, Gracy : And we read again, to see if our action in the kitchen is effective, so we do not have to move back an foward.
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:53 PM, Gracy : Deleted Message
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:54 PM, Gracy : This practice really helps me even now, when I cook. In my head, I can be like, I need to do this and this to make cooking time shorter
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:56 PM, Gordon : wowww, that all sounds so precies
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:56 PM, Gordon : and so usefule!!
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:56 PM, Gracy : it was my fav. class from highscool
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:56 PM, Gordon : I don't think there's anything useful i learned from hs
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:57 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:57 PM, Gracy : we had midterm and finals
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:57 PM, Gracy : midterm was opening the brunch cafe for teachers and staff members as a guest, we did it all by ourselves self from managing cooking and serving
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:58 PM, Gracy : And finals was opening the fine dining by inviting parents and family members
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:59 PM, Gordon : what the heck! that sounds crazy
Apr 15, 2024 at 10:59 PM, Gordon : and fun!

Apr 15, 2024 at 11:01 PM, Gordon : that's so crazy
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:02 PM, Gordon : i think it's borderline illegal for students in hs in the states to make money through school events
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:02 PM, Gracy : oh really?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:02 PM, Gracy : even in your last year?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:03 PM, Gordon : yeah, like, anytime there's money involved with a school event
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:03 PM, Gordon : it just goes to the school and not students
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:03 PM, Gracy : we saw this more of adults giving them an allowance to cheer them up than paying them
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:03 PM, Gracy : :(
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:03 PM, Gordon : Yeah, only time you could get tips or money as a highschooler is to have an actual job
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:04 PM, Gracy : do you have hospitality in hs?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:04 PM, Gordon : we had something like it I think
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:04 PM, Gracy : I see I see
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:04 PM, Gordon : it's usually called "home economics" in the states
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:05 PM, Gracy : do you choose subjects in highschool?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:05 PM, Gordon : so you mostly learn how to do stuff yourself at home, like cooking, sewing, managing budgets
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:05 PM, Gracy : so you learn them all at once 
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:05 PM, Gordon : yeah, it's basically the only class to learn real life skills
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:06 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:06 PM, Gordon : yes we do, but we have to meet requirements
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:06 PM, Gordon : it's kinda like college but a bit more strict
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:06 PM, Gordon : like every year, no matter what, you have to take a math class
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:06 PM, Gracy : what you choose effects you going to the university?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:06 PM, Gordon : mmmm, not really
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:06 PM, Gracy : that is same in south africa too
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:07 PM, Gracy : oh, okay, in south africa different major requires different classes in high school
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:07 PM, Gordon : ahhh, i see
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:07 PM, Gracy : like if you wanna take hospital management you have to take hospitality, if you wanna major in doc. you have to take biology
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:07 PM, Gordon : yeah, we didn't have majors
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:07 PM, Gordon : everyone gets the same degree
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:08 PM, Gracy : so you can choose subjects when you are gr.10 so by then, most of South African students knows what they wanna do in collage.
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:08 PM, Gracy : we don't have majors, but they have to choose subjects depends on what they want to learn in the university
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:10 PM, Gordon : ahhh, ok, maybe it is more like that
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:10 PM, Gordon : but most students have no clue what they want to do going into college
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:10 PM, Gordon : most of the time, people just pick "the hardest" classes
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:11 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:11 PM, Gordon : so they look better to colleges
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:11 PM, Gracy : I see
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:12 PM, Gracy : I also did not know exactly what to do I guess
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:12 PM, Gracy : I just took subjects that I wanted to do ㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:13 PM, Gordon : that's nice!
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:13 PM, Gordon : it was actually kind of annoying for us
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:13 PM, Gracy : why?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:13 PM, Gordon : b/c it was slightly a competition to see who could do the hardest courses
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:13 PM, Gordon : like have you heard of AP courses?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:13 PM, Gracy : oh really?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:14 PM, Gracy : upper class? that gives credit?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:14 PM, Gordon : yeah, they were suppose to be as hard as a real college course
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gordon : so you could actually earn credit depending on where you went
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gracy : ah-hu
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gordon : so a lot of students kinda "competed" to take as many as possible
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gordon : including me haha
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gracy : lol
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:15 PM, Gracy : how many ap class did you took?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gordon : oof
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gordon : I don't know if I remember the number anymore
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gordon : maybe 11?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gracy : in a year?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gordon : oh, no way
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gracy : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:18 PM, Gordon : you could only take 7 classes a year
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:19 PM, Gracy : I see I see
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:19 PM, Gracy : Korea highschool is worse I think
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:20 PM, Gordon : I can see that
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:20 PM, Gordon : I hear Asian countries have really hard school life
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:20 PM, Gracy : you choose between liberal arts and natural sciences. Then you take whole subjects under that line you choose. You don't have choice
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:20 PM, Gracy : so if you choose natural sciences, but you like biology but do not want to take physics? no choice, you gotta do it. and also you can not take subjects from liberal arts
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:21 PM, Gracy : Yeah… they sound crazy…. I think they come to home like at 10pm
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gordon : awww, sounds miserable
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gordon : this is even worse
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gracy : but talking about hs
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gracy : made me realize...
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gordon : Does Korean school do 6 days a week too?
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gracy : that it is 10 years ago
Apr 15, 2024 at 11:23 PM, Gracy : oh, nooo they do 5 days

Apr 16, 2024 at 12:31 AM, Gordon : yeah, go figure huh?
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:33 AM, Gracy : what does go figure mean?
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:33 AM, Gordon : mmmm
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:33 AM, Gordon : "go figure" usually is kind of a sarcastic expression
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:34 AM, Gordon : like it's more like if you said "it's not easy to figure this out"
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:35 AM, Gordon : so if it's raining you could say "huh, I guess I needed an umbrella, go figure"
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:35 AM, Gracy : so it's like you are saying obviously?
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:37 AM, Gordon : mmm, yeah
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:37 AM, Gordon : like, it's obvious
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:37 AM, Gordon : once you realize about it
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:37 AM, Gracy : I see I see
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:38 AM, Gordon : another example "Gracy doesn't like it when you steal defuses from her, go figure"
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:38 AM, Gracy : oh, oh I got this
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:38 AM, Gracy : so like
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:39 AM, Gracy : "when Gordon take defuse from Gracy, it makes her upset, go figure"
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:39 AM, Gordon : yeah!...
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:42 AM, Gracy : okay
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:42 AM, Gracy : so can I also say like this?
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:43 AM, Gracy : when I was in Gr.5 my mom made me go to an English academy after school and I hated learning English.
Apr 16, 2024 at 12:43 AM, Gracy : So I had a big fight my mom and I quit the English Academy

Apr 16, 2024 at 1:19 AM, Gracy : btw
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:20 AM, Gracy : 예 is like yes to the yes or no Q.
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:20 AM, Gracy : Okay I am wrong
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:20 AM, Gracy : not big difference
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:21 AM, Gracy : but I think we use 네 more in casual conversation
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:21 AM, Gracy : 예 is very… um… textbook style
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:23 AM, Gordon : 네 for yes?

Apr 16, 2024 at 1:32 AM, Gracy : so we talked about the tax right
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:32 AM, Gracy : ?
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:32 AM, Gracy : I just wondered what happens,
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:32 AM, Gracy : when you live in Korea you follow Korean law according to the tax, so nothing to worry about us tax, just report that you are here
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:33 AM, Gordon : ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:33 AM, Gracy : FYI
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:33 AM, Gordon : The US isn’t that nice
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:34 AM, Gordon : No matter where you are, if you’re a US citizen, you should be paying taxes on income
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:34 AM, Gracy : really?
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:34 AM, Gordon : Mhmm
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:34 AM, Gracy : I can ask some professors here, I don't think they are paying again to the us
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:35 AM, Gracy : are they?
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:35 AM, Gordon : I think there might be loopholes and stuff yeah
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:35 AM, Gordon : But generally you’re suppose to pay taxes
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:35 AM, Gordon : It’s even harder for me to hide if I keep working for Google
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:35 AM, Gordon : Bc employers report how much they pay employees to the government
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:38 AM, Gordon : I think the US won’t charge as much tax, if you pay taxes to a different country
Apr 16, 2024 at 1:42 AM, Gracy : Photo

May 12, 2024 at 6:54 PM, Gracy : again and again
May 12, 2024 at 6:54 PM, Gracy : but while I was doing budgeting
May 12, 2024 at 6:55 PM, Gracy : maybe it is clever to just live in a rent for another year...
May 12, 2024 at 6:56 PM, Gordon : It’s clever
May 12, 2024 at 6:56 PM, Gordon : But will you be happy?
May 12, 2024 at 6:57 PM, Gracy : i dnt know...
May 12, 2024 at 6:57 PM, Gracy : but I did budgeting too
May 12, 2024 at 6:57 PM, Gracy : but since Sunny is hear
May 12, 2024 at 6:57 PM, Gracy : *not hear
May 12, 2024 at 6:58 PM, Gracy : I really have to cut down my budget
May 12, 2024 at 6:58 PM, Gracy : and this will make me unhappy right now
May 12, 2024 at 6:58 PM, Gracy : and also for the future, when I move in, I could barely save money if I am in that house
May 12, 2024 at 6:58 PM, Gracy : but we need money for the marriage
May 12, 2024 at 6:59 PM, Gracy : but again, I dnt know what will be the right answer
May 12, 2024 at 7:00 PM, Gordon : Yeah, plans are really hard to make
May 12, 2024 at 7:00 PM, Gordon : But if you move in, you technically could switch if you had to right?
May 12, 2024 at 7:00 PM, Gordon : If you do interior design
May 12, 2024 at 7:01 PM, Gracy : what do you mean?
May 12, 2024 at 7:01 PM, Gracy : switch what?
May 12, 2024 at 7:01 PM, Gordon : Like live in your house for a month or so
May 12, 2024 at 7:01 PM, Gracy : ??
May 12, 2024 at 7:01 PM, Gordon : Then if it’s not working
May 12, 2024 at 7:01 PM, Gordon : Find a renter
May 12, 2024 at 7:02 PM, Gordon : And you find a cheaper place
May 12, 2024 at 7:02 PM, Gracy : so you mean
May 12, 2024 at 7:02 PM, Gracy : if I move in to my house
May 12, 2024 at 7:02 PM, Gracy : and if I want to move out then I can do it later then u mean?
May 12, 2024 at 7:02 PM, Gordon : Yeah 
May 12, 2024 at 7:02 PM, Gracy : but in that case
May 12, 2024 at 7:03 PM, Gracy : time line should be
May 12, 2024 at 7:03 PM, Gordon : Sorry, driving rn
May 12, 2024 at 7:03 PM, Gracy : interior - move in - find renter - move out. but it seems like kind of waste of money for the interior if I am gonna live there for short time
May 12, 2024 at 7:03 PM, Gracy : oh okay I'll just leave message dnt have to reply nw
May 12, 2024 at 7:04 PM, Gordon : Interior is for renters too, no?
May 12, 2024 at 7:04 PM, Gordon : Make it reliable to find them
May 12, 2024 at 7:05 PM, Gracy : Also good thing about finding cheap place this year is dnt have to worry abt finding renter and also can save interior money and see if I can use some of them for my merriage if I want to marry u after a year
May 12, 2024 at 7:05 PM, Gracy : yea, but I wouldn't do it high quality and some part I wouldn't do it too if it is for the renters
May 12, 2024 at 7:05 PM, Gracy : like bathroom, I am putting auto hair dryer, and that is very fancy if I am doing it only for renters
May 12, 2024 at 7:14 PM, Gordon : wowwww
May 12, 2024 at 7:15 PM, Gordon : sounds so fancy
May 12, 2024 at 7:15 PM, Gordon : yeah, cheap place sounds easier on budget from how i see it
May 12, 2024 at 7:15 PM, Gordon : but will you be okay living in a cheap place?
May 12, 2024 at 7:15 PM, Gracy : on the weekend I was in the fantasy world in my head
May 12, 2024 at 7:15 PM, Gracy : but doing the budgeting
May 12, 2024 at 7:15 PM, Gracy : drag me into reality
May 12, 2024 at 7:16 PM, Gracy : that is actually fine
May 12, 2024 at 7:16 PM, Gracy : It is pretty much similar space, if I think of house now just without Sunny's space
May 12, 2024 at 7:16 PM, Gordon : Emoticons
May 12, 2024 at 7:16 PM, Gracy : I am gonna move to the same apartment but next building with smaller space
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gracy : where Sieun is living right now
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gordon : Still prug 10?!?
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gracy : yup
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gracy : that is easier
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gordon : Emoticons 
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gordon : Is it ok if I say I like that plan a little bit more now?
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gracy : no
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gordon : oh
May 12, 2024 at 7:17 PM, Gracy : be supportive on both side

May 12, 2024 at 7:19 PM, Gracy : should I buy larger bed?
May 12, 2024 at 7:19 PM, Gordon : You don’t have to!
