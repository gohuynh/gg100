[Gordon] [5:26 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [5:27 PM] My brain is too old and slow :(
[Gracy] [5:27 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öãme too
[Gracy] [5:27 PM] So I aksed to google
[Gordon] [5:27 PM] What game did you decide to do?
[Gracy] [5:27 PM] I am thinking between
[Gracy] [5:27 PM] two truth and one lie
[Gracy] [5:27 PM] this is simple quick
[Gracy] [5:27 PM] but not ‚Ä¶. sure‚Ä¶ if I can make them lie cuz it is happening in church
[Gracy] [5:28 PM] the other is [Name that Person]
Each person writes three interesting facts about themselves and puts them into a pile with the rest of their group. And they pick one, and have to guess who that is
[Gordon] [5:29 PM] Oh, those are good!
[Gordon] [5:30 PM] What a great company!
[Gracy] [5:30 PM] Yea, google gave me good one
[Gracy] [5:30 PM] whoever works there must be so cool
[Gordon] [5:30 PM] Photo
[Gordon] [5:31 PM] I was trying to remember a game like this
[Gordon] [5:31 PM] The idea is everyone says 1 fun fact about themselves
[Gordon] [5:31 PM] Then going in a circle or something, you have to remember who said which fun fact
[Gordon] [5:31 PM] And you try to name everybody
[Gracy] [5:32 PM] That sounds fun  too!
[Gordon] [5:32 PM] I think it was person A says a fun fact
[Gordon] [5:33 PM] Then person B says person A‚Äôs fun fact and then their own fun fact
[Gordon] [5:33 PM] C says A, B, then C
[Gracy] [5:33 PM] But
[Gordon] [5:33 PM] And it goes all the way back to person A to say it all over again to ‚Äúwin‚Äù
[Gracy] [5:34 PM] if A already said fun facts about B and C. Like they already know the answers right?
[Gordon] [5:34 PM] Yeah, but it‚Äôs kinda a memory test
[Gracy] [5:34 PM] Ohh I sea what you mean
[Gordon] [5:34 PM] Bc by person like J, they have to remember everything before
[Gracy] [5:35 PM] I am not sure if it is in Eng. too but we have game called when you go to the school
[Gracy] [5:35 PM] basically you name things in school in circle until someone forgot the order
[Gordon] [5:36 PM] What is the order?
[Gracy] [5:36 PM] Like I say pencil, you say pencil and paper, and Bebe says pencil and paper and notebook
[Gordon] [5:36 PM] Ohhhhh
[Gordon] [5:36 PM] Then yes! Like that!
[Gordon] [5:36 PM] I remember it being funny afterwards
[Gordon] [5:36 PM] Bc everybody ends up knowing person A‚Äôs fun fact really well
[Gracy] [5:36 PM] hahaha
[Gordon] [5:37 PM] I forgot what happens if someone makes a mistake
[Gracy] [5:37 PM] well I think it is good game to play if you want to make A popular in the school
[Gracy] [5:37 PM] get smacked?
[Gordon] [5:37 PM] Maybe‚Ä¶ could be‚Ä¶ probably‚Ä¶
[Gordon] [5:37 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gordon] [5:38 PM] Ohhh, they might to go to the end of the line
[Gracy] [5:38 PM] Oh okay
[Gordon] [5:38 PM] It might be a long game if there‚Äôs a lot of people
[Gracy] [5:39 PM] It sounds like it lol
[Gordon] [5:40 PM] This one sounded good too
[Gordon] [5:40 PM] Maybe split the group into teams, so it‚Äôs less people to guess from?
[Gracy] [5:40 PM] yup we will split them into groups
[Gordon] [5:41 PM] Ahh makes sense
[Gordon] [5:41 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [5:41 PM] This just reminds me of old ice breakers
[Gordon] [5:41 PM] And the anxiety
[Gracy] [5:42 PM] haha why anxiety
[Gordon] [5:42 PM] The introvert in me haha‚Ä¶
[Gracy] [5:42 PM] Oh makes sense!
[Gracy] [5:43 PM] I am very nervous that I have to lead the game in front of the crowd
[Gordon] [5:43 PM] I believe in you!!
[Gordon] [5:43 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [5:44 PM] Are you going to be the main person leading?
[Gracy] [5:44 PM] I have another person who is doing  this with me
[Gracy] [5:44 PM] but we haven't decided whos the main
[Gracy] [5:44 PM] so I am trying to make her as the main lead
[Gracy] [5:44 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [5:45 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gordon] [5:45 PM] Good luck!
[Gordon] [5:45 PM] Maybe you can use your president power and make her do it
[Gracy] [5:49 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [5:49 PM] my presidential power is not effective over there yet
[Gordon] [5:50 PM] What?!?

[Gracy] [6:02 PM] I was innocent and pure, but the society corrupted me so badly.
[Gracy] [6:03 PM] Of course, I'll never trick you!

[Gordon] [4:54 PM] Hmmm, that‚Äôs a good question
[Gordon] [4:56 PM] I think you‚Äôre already on track for that to happen. If anything, Gordon might be stuck to you for a couple of years
[Gracy] [4:58 PM] That sounds like a plan! So I'll have a personal tutor?

[Gordon] [6:02 PM] and they just wait and see if you react to stuff
[Gracy] [6:17 PM] I see
[Gracy] [6:18 PM] when was the last time you did?

[Gracy] [6:35 PM] lol I could see that
[Gracy] [6:35 PM] Good deal!
[Gracy] [6:37 PM] When my brother was young, he had little skin problems that something pops up on his skin
[Gracy] [6:38 PM] so he had to remove that with a laser every week, and you can see how hurtful that is so My mom bought him burgers after the hospital. 
[Gracy] [6:39 PM] And I was genuinely happy to eat the burger with him if I followed hom and him to the hospital! :)
[Gordon] [6:39 PM] All the benefits without much of the cost haha
[Gordon] [6:40 PM] are you allergic to anything?

[Gracy] [6:41 PM] I think I was allergic to Pineapple when I was young, my tongue was itchy, and swollen, but one day I found that it was okay now
[Gordon] [6:48 PM] haha

[Gracy] [9:48 PM] I had a slight wonder why he did not text me and you were just being nice waiting for my work to finish :)
[Gordon] [9:49 PM] so powerful...
[Gordon] [9:50 PM] hehe, partly, other part was just too nervous to think while at work
[Gordon] [9:50 PM] so that's why I think Gracy is soooooo powerful
[Gracy] [9:53 PM] Thank you
[Gracy] [9:54 PM] I think I am covering myself well so far
[Gordon] [9:55 PM] I think so too
[Gordon] [9:55 PM] that's why I keep saying I think Gracy is definitely cooler than me
[Gordon] [9:55 PM] unlike my ex husband, Gracy swept me off my feet

[Gordon] [9:58 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [10:00 PM] But sorry I didn‚Äôt text first and made Gracy go through the stress!

[Gracy] [10:40 PM] how people can remember different tones?
[Gordon] [10:42 PM] No clue
[Gordon] [10:42 PM] I asked my mom before to teach me how to do tones
[Gordon] [10:42 PM] and she just said "oh do this to sound like this, do this to sound like that" and it all sounded the same
[Gracy] [10:42 PM] ....
[Gracy] [10:42 PM] I was kind of hoping if you can help me with the tone!
[Gordon] [10:45 PM] I wasn't joking about this
[Gordon] [10:46 PM] Emoticons

[Gracy] [10:52 PM] like when you click microsoft icon under the screen
[Gordon] [10:52 PM] because "windows key" + S opens up the menu like that
[Gracy] [10:53 PM] how do i turn that off‚Ä¶?
[Gordon] [10:53 PM] hmmm, it's not a good answer, but what happens if you press your "windows key"/"CMD" right after you switch

[Gordon] [6:31 PM] I was in France for one of my cousin‚Äôs wedding
[Gracy] [6:32 PM] when you go to a wedding abroad, does the couple pay for you to come?
[Gordon] [6:33 PM] I think it depends on how rich they are „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gracy] [6:33 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [6:33 PM] lol true, and you are family member so
[Gordon] [6:33 PM] This wedding was just in Paris

[Gordon] [6:34 PM] But my other cousin got married in 2010
[Gordon] [6:34 PM] And they booked a chateau

[Gordon] [6:38 PM] My mom, dad, sister, and me
[Gracy] [6:38 PM] so it was a wedding only with close family members?

[Gordon] [6:48 PM] What are Korean weddings like?
[Gracy] [6:48 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öãnot really
[Gracy] [6:48 PM] Korean wedding is very ceremonial
[Gracy] [6:48 PM] and we do not have reception
[Gracy] [6:49 PM] bride and groom will walk in they'll do the vows, parents will give them some words, cut cakes 
[Gracy] [6:50 PM] pretty much that is all
[Gracy] [6:50 PM] (usually)
[Gordon] [6:51 PM] wow, no reception?
[Gordon] [6:51 PM] sounds somewhat quick then
[Gordon] [6:51 PM] would you say 1st birthdays for babies are more fun than weddings?
[Gracy] [6:52 PM] We do it when baby turns 100 days old
[Gracy] [6:52 PM] And yes!
[Gordon] [6:53 PM] oh, ic
[Gordon] [6:53 PM] my cousin has a Korean husband

[Gracy] [6:56 PM] I dnk abt what other culture does
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] but one thing we do is we will put objects in front of the baby like pen and book, money, paint brush, stethoscope or anything they parents want
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] and we see that whichever baby grabs first, is what he will be in the future
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] Like, money for the business men, pen and book for the scholars
[Gracy] [6:59 PM] It is so fun to see how parents trying hard to make the baby to grab what they want like stethoscope „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [6:59 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gordon] [6:59 PM] Yeah, that happened at my cousin‚Äôs party for her son
[Gracy] [7:00 PM] do you remember what did he grab?

Upon completing the entry processes at Incheon Airport, you can easily find taxis at the airport. In case you need assistance, feel free to ask any staff member, and they will help you find a taxi. Please show the following message to the taxi driver, which contains your address. If the driver has any questions, they can contact me using my phone number provided below. While most international credit cards should work, I recommend having some cash in Korean Won (about 100,000 KRW, which is approximately 100 USD) as a precaution.

[Gracy] [1:14 AM] *He bit through the power lines and took out power on campus prior to a men‚Äôs basketball conference championship game against our biggest rival. The game ended up getting pushed to the following day because of it, so they drove out for no reason

When ‚Äúsparky‚Äù was found he immediately became a campus celebrity, with students surrounding him with acorns and flowers. This continued on for years, with him even being mention in the inauguration of the university‚Äôs president, and memorial acorns handed out at 2018‚Äôs graduation.

[Gordon] [5:37 PM] the chickens are taken care of so well haha

[Gordon] [6:05 PM] with cow, we can make cheese
[Gracy] [6:05 PM] can we make more food with cheese?
[Gordon] [6:05 PM] and with cheese, we get one step closer to becoming a pizza farm
[Gracy] [6:05 PM] like cheese burger?
[Gracy] [6:05 PM] pizza farm? can we do that?
[Gordon] [6:05 PM] I forgot what actual foods there are, but I think cheese is an ingredient
[Gordon] [6:06 PM] we'd need tomatoes too haha
[Gracy] [6:06 PM] we have tomatoes!
[Gracy] [6:06 PM] but I think I sold them all hmm
[Gordon] [6:06 PM] it's ok, we don't have the recipe either

[Gracy] [6:06 PM] what should I do?
[Gracy] [6:06 PM] I am in trouble
[Gordon] [6:07 PM] uh oh? what happened?

[Gordon] [6:12 PM] the choice is yours my dear
[Gracy] [6:13 PM] I can not choooose
[Gracy] [6:13 PM] have you been there both?
[Gordon] [6:28 PM] i've never been to either actually
[Gordon] [6:28 PM] so new experience for us both!
[Gracy] [6:28 PM] oh nooo
[Gracy] [6:29 PM] you are not helpful for me to make descision

[Gordon] [6:30 PM] i'm sorry...
[Gordon] [6:30 PM] i've heard good things about both though!
[Gracy] [6:39 PM] am I too old to go both?
[Gordon] [6:39 PM] No, I don't think so!
[Gordon] [6:39 PM] but tickets can be expensive
[Gordon] [6:39 PM] especially if we want to do fast passes
[Gracy] [6:40 PM] Do you think we can handle two amusement park in a week?
[Gracy] [6:40 PM] I don't think so‚Ä¶
[Gracy] [6:40 PM] hmmm okay
[Gracy] [6:40 PM] I made my mind
[Gordon] [6:42 PM] maybe if we take a break day to relax
[Gracy] [6:44 PM] yea but you are right
[Gracy] [6:44 PM] we don't have money for both of them
[Gracy] [6:44 PM] The reason why I am having difficult time to choose between two is
[Gracy] [6:45 PM] I've been to Universal Studio in Japan, and at the same time, I can go there more easily but not Disney. But also I like Universal Studio's characters more.
[Gordon] [6:47 PM] want me to flip a coin?
[Gracy] [6:49 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [6:50 PM] okay I am being annoying now
[Gracy] [6:50 PM] I'll tell you when I make up my mind
[Gordon] [6:50 PM] haha nonono, it's ok
[Gordon] [6:50 PM] i think it's cute
[Gordon] [6:50 PM] i'm sorry I can't be much of help
[Gordon] [6:50 PM] I can ask my coworkers tomorrow which one they recommend
[Gordon] [7:28 PM] Would it be crazy, if we went to universal in LA
[Gordon] [7:28 PM] and when we go to Japan, we go to disneyland there?

Upon completing the entry processes at Incheon Airport, you can easily find taxis at the airport. In case you need assistance, feel free to ask any staff member, and they will help you find a taxi. Please show the following message to the taxi driver, which contains your address. If the driver has any questions, they can contact me using my phone number provided below. While most international credit cards should work, I recommend having some cash in Korean Won (about 100,000 KRW, which is approximately 100 USD) as a precaution.

[Gracy] [11:28 PM] did you write by making the combination of words you used?
[Gracy] [11:28 PM] *you learned?
[Gracy] [11:30 PM] Ïòà is very formal and text book way to say yes
[Gracy] [11:30 PM] you can say Ïùë in casual way to friends
[Gracy] [11:30 PM] not to older person
[Gordon] [11:30 PM] ÍπåÎßàÍ∑ÄÏùò Ïïå ÎòîÎäî Îã≠Ïùò Ïïå

[Gordon] [11:31 PM] Is duolingo trying to teach me to speak like an old person?
[Gracy] [11:32 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öãno it is different that you know Ïùò and skipping it on purpose and you doesn't know at all
[Gracy] [11:32 PM] just one more thing, Îã≠(Ïùò)Ïïå
[Gracy] [11:33 PM] changes to Îã¨Í±Ä (due to the pronounciation) 
[Gracy] [11:33 PM] so Îã¨Í±Ä = chicken engg
[Gracy] [11:33 PM] egg
[Gordon] [11:33 PM] Is it just for chicken egg?
[Gracy] [11:33 PM] yup yup
[Gordon] [11:33 PM] Also, is Î∞ù a word?
[Gordon] [11:34 PM] Duolingo keeps making me remember this
[Gracy] [11:34 PM] Îã≠Ïïå still makes sense but it sounds like you are talking about chicken's egg and Îã¨Í±Ä is like you are speaking chicken's egg for food ingredients. You know like cow and beef
[Gracy] [11:34 PM] ?? just Î∞ù?
[Gordon] [11:34 PM] Yeah, I don‚Äôt get it either
[Gracy] [11:35 PM] can you capture the page?
[Gordon] [11:35 PM] It was teaching me like Í∞Å, Í∞ë, Í∞î
[Gordon] [11:35 PM] And would throw in Î∞ù
[Gracy] [11:35 PM] Oh, I think they are giving you like random word
[Gordon] [11:35 PM] And I was confused why that „Ñπ is in there
[Gracy] [11:36 PM] to see you if you can read hangul and to practice your pronounciation
[Gordon] [11:36 PM] It‚Äôs weird though, because all I hear from it is Î∞ï
[Gracy] [11:36 PM] oh, so we have something called double consonants and double vowels.
[Gracy] [11:36 PM] oooh.. I need screen sharing to explain this to you
[Gracy] [11:36 PM] but let me try
[Gracy] [11:37 PM] so remember when „Öò sounds like „Öó+„Öè?
[Gordon] [11:37 PM] Yes!
[Gracy] [11:37 PM] can you try to pronoucne rk at the same time?
[Gracy] [11:38 PM] you will realize that you can only pronounce k only
[Gordon] [11:38 PM] Is it kinda like ‚Äúlk‚Äù in milk?
[Gracy] [11:38 PM] or rg?
[Gracy] [11:39 PM] yea kinda
[Gracy] [11:39 PM] then you might ask
[Gracy] [11:40 PM] we can just write down Î∞ï instead of Î∞ù
[Gracy] [11:40 PM] why we need Î∞ù
[Gracy] [11:40 PM] that have to go into deep in the Korean gramma
[Gordon] [11:40 PM] Oh, lol, so a lesson in the future?
[Gracy] [11:40 PM] nono
[Gracy] [11:40 PM] I am telling you now
[Gordon] [11:41 PM] Yes professor
[Gracy] [11:41 PM] so in korean bottom consonent is called Î∞õÏπ® batchim
[Gracy] [11:41 PM] Í∞ê = „ÖÅ is Î∞õÏπ®
[Gracy] [11:42 PM] and Î∞õÏπ® effects the sounds of the letter that comes next
[Gracy] [11:42 PM] especially „Öá and „Öé
[Gracy] [11:42 PM] so, if I say Í∞ÄÏù¥ = Ga i
[Gracy] [11:43 PM] but if I say Í∞êÏù¥. „ÖÅ from the Í∞ê moves up to the Ïù¥. so it sounds like Ga Mi
[Gracy] [11:43 PM] do you understand?
[Gordon] [11:43 PM] mhmmm
[Gordon] [11:43 PM] that make sense
[Gracy] [11:43 PM] so when I say Î∞ï
[Gracy] [11:44 PM] Î∞ïÏù¥
[Gracy] [11:44 PM] it is Bak i
[Gracy] [11:44 PM] but when I say Î∞ùÏù¥
[Gracy] [11:44 PM] „Ñ± in Î∞ù and Ïù¥ from „Öá mixed up together and it becomes
[Gracy] [11:45 PM] Î∞ùÏù¥ = Î∞úÎÅº = Bal Ggi
[Gordon] [11:45 PM] That‚Äôs why Í∞á Îã∏ and ÎãΩ all sound the same by themselves, but different when next to a different syllable?
[Gracy] [11:45 PM] Yes! you are genious@
[Gordon] [11:45 PM] Only thanks to my professor
[Gracy] [11:46 PM] Photo
[Gracy] [11:46 PM] but merely different, cuz „Ñ∑/„ÖÜ/„Öå is in the same pronunciation group in the table
[Gracy] [11:48 PM] but you really do not have to memorize the rule, you will get it naturally, I mean Gad, Gat, Gatt all sounds same even if I write them down in english right? (If you pronounce a as ah)
[Gordon] [11:48 PM] Very helpful!
[Gordon] [11:48 PM] Yes professor
[Gracy] [11:48 PM] Emoticons

[Gordon] [11:50 PM] Both my kidneys?!?
[Gracy] [11:50 PM] hey! know
[Gracy] [11:50 PM] ?

[Gracy] [11:50 PM] what is wrong with my english
[Gracy] [11:50 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [11:50 PM] no!
[Gordon] [11:50 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gordon] [11:51 PM] I still know what you meant
[Gracy] [11:51 PM] fancy experience in hotel Gordon might be paying the bill
[Gordon] [11:51 PM] What makes it fancy?
[Gracy] [11:51 PM] Read this site! It explains really well

[Gordon] [11:58 PM] Then hotel Gordon will be super fancy for Gracy in return for the lessons
[Gracy] [11:59 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [11:59 PM] Oh, 1 more question
[Gordon] [11:59 PM] If that‚Äôs ok professor?
--------------- Monday, April 15, 2024 ---------------
[Gracy] [12:00 AM] sure!
[Gracy] [12:00 AM] you are luping my office time so well
[Gordon] [12:03 AM] Ok, duolingo is teaching me Î∏îÎùΩÌïòÍ≥† ÌïòÏù¥Î∏å as black and white
[Gordon] [12:03 AM] Are they just being lazy and teaching me loan words again?
[Gracy] [12:03 AM] Î∏îÎûôÌïòÍ≥† ÌôîÏù¥Ìä∏
[Gracy] [12:03 AM] what do you mean loa words?
[Gordon] [12:04 AM] (I added the ÌïòÍ≥†)
[Gordon] [12:04 AM] Is it really just ‚Äúbeulak‚Äù ~ black
[Gordon] [12:05 AM] And ‚Äúhaiteu‚Äù ~ white
[Gracy] [12:12 AM] good good
[Gracy] [12:12 AM] you can not skip ÌïòÍ≥†
[Gracy] [12:12 AM] so it is Î∏îÎûôÌïòÍ≥† ÌôîÏù¥Ìä∏ÌïòÍ≥†
[Gracy] [12:13 AM] *Î∏îÎûôÌïòÍ≥† ÌôîÏù¥Ìä∏
[Gracy] [12:13 AM] Í≥†Îì†ÌïòÍ≥† ÏòàÏùÄÏù¥
[Gordon] [12:14 AM] And are those two the actual words for black and white?
[Gracy] [12:14 AM] yes!
[Gracy] [12:14 AM] but if you wanna say pure korean
[Gracy] [12:14 AM] you can say
[Gracy] [12:14 AM] Í≤ÄÏ†ïÌïòÍ≥† ÌïòÏñÄÏÉâ
[Gracy] [12:15 AM] Í≤ÄÏ†ïÌïòÍ≥† ÌïòÏñë
[Gordon] [12:15 AM] Is it more common to say the other way?
[Gracy] [12:15 AM] we just say black and white a lot too like Î∏îÎûô ÌôîÏù¥Ìä∏ but in Korean black is Í≤ÄÏ†ï  white is ÌïòÏñë
[Gracy] [12:16 AM] depends‚Ä¶ but ppl will understand fine either way
[Gracy] [12:16 AM] I think we say Î∏îÎûô ÌôîÏù¥Ìä∏ more often when we talk about product colour. like I got Î∏îÎûô shirts
[Gracy] [12:17 AM] but we say Í≤ÄÏ†ï and ÌïòÏñë with others like when I found out I failed my test, my vision became Í≤ÄÏ†ï
[Gordon] [12:18 AM] It just feels like Ïó¥Ïâ¨ ÎòêÍ∑π ÌÇ§
[Gordon] [12:18 AM] Okok
[Gracy] [12:18 AM] ????
[Gracy] [12:18 AM] can you try to write down again?
[Gordon] [12:19 AM] I like using Î∏îÎùΩ anyways
[Gracy] [12:19 AM] no no
[Gracy] [12:19 AM] try to write this again
[Gracy] [12:19 AM] and this too
[Gordon] [12:20 AM] Ïó¥Ïá† ÎòêÎäî ÌÇ§

[Gordon] [12:24 AM] I feel like i‚Äôm in elementary school again
[Gordon] [12:24 AM] Ehhh, maybe middle school actually
[Gracy] [12:25 AM] why middle school?
[Gordon] [12:26 AM] Middle school is where I learned proper grammar
[Gordon] [12:26 AM] And started memorizing more words
[Gracy] [12:27 AM] Oh I see I see
[Gracy] [12:27 AM] but are you enjoying learning it?
[Gordon] [12:27 AM] Yeah, the alphabet is very interesting
[Gordon] [12:28 AM] But I do feel like i‚Äôm in school again trying to memorize words
[Gracy] [12:28 AM] haha don't worry about the words too much
[Gracy] [12:30 AM] You can get it naturally by getting exposed to Korean little by little if you plan to hang around with me for the long term.
[Gordon] [12:30 AM] I hope I get to hang around you for the long term!
[Gracy] [12:31 AM] you do?
[Gordon] [12:31 AM] But what about you?! You might have a bf who knows the same amount of Korean as a 4 year old?!?
[Gracy] [12:32 AM] but you might have gf who knows the same amount of English as a 13ys old??
[Gordon] [12:33 AM] I think 13 is way better than 4
[Gordon] [12:33 AM] AND you know better than a 13 year old
[Gordon] [12:33 AM] You could be college level

[Gracy] [9:13 PM] Gordon, thank you so much for always being nice to me even when I am a little grumpy üòõ. You are one of the nicest people I have ever known in my life and I am so lucky to know you. Will you be nice to me all the time in the future too..? üëâüëà I am so excited about the future we will have fun together.

[Gordon] [9:15 PM] Of course Gracy!! You‚Äôre one of the first people I‚Äôve ever met where I feel like I can completely relax with and just be comfortable. And you make me feel so much more confident in who I am. So I‚Äôll always be nice to you as long as you‚Äôll let me hang out with you
[Gracy] [9:17 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [9:18 PM] Everything ok Gracy?
[Gracy] [9:19 PM] yea! I am just touched what you said
[Gordon] [9:20 PM] I know we've only known each other for only a month and a half, but I don't think I've ever gotten along with someone so well and so quickly
[Gordon] [9:21 PM] So, that's why i'm super glad to have gotten to know Gracy and get to be with her so much when we can
[Gracy] [9:24 PM] I think it is crazy and a bit scary that we get to know each other too fast and what if it runs out too fast too. 
[Gracy] [9:27 PM] But also at the same time, I feel like this could work out if it is with you. cuz you seem like consistent and considerate people who treat relationships with others seriously. 
[Gordon] [9:29 PM] I'm happy you think that way, because I'm always scared of annoying or making people mad
[Gordon] [9:30 PM] And I know what you mean with this, but I also think it's a good sign that we're both worried about this
[Gordon] [9:30 PM] I think the people who get in trouble when rushing things are like romeo and juliet and don't really notice how fast things are moving
[Gracy] [9:33 PM] yea.. I know what you mean, you better not take my defuse next time
[Gracy] [9:33 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [9:33 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gracy] [9:33 PM] you are right, thank you for pointing out this. I agree with you it is a good sign
[Gordon] [9:38 PM] And anytime you don‚Äôt feel comfortable, let me know ok? I don‚Äôt have much experience in romance, so i‚Äôm going to mess up. I say this a lot to you, but you can remind me that we have plenty of time for us to figure things out
[Gordon] [9:38 PM] No need to rush things either
[Gracy] [9:39 PM] okay!
[Gracy] [9:39 PM] Thank you for saying that
[Gracy] [9:39 PM] but I wanna rush
[Gracy] [9:39 PM] this last two weeks!
[Gordon] [9:40 PM] Good, me too
[Gordon] [9:41 PM] but we also have so many future adventures in store for us too
[Gordon] [9:44 PM] Anyways this is talk we should have face to face üòÅ. Thank you for bringing this up though. Makes me feel more confident that I‚Äôm doing something right
[Gracy] [9:44 PM] where is that store huh? let me buy them all at once
[Gracy] [9:45 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öãthat is true, I just brought this up so randomly cuz I just wanted to thank you

[Gordon] [10:31 PM] I wish, but Gracy also needs to sleep!
[Gordon] [10:31 PM] She's a young woman who needs her sleep
[Gracy] [10:31 PM] your wish will come true
[Gordon] [10:31 PM] to grow big and strong
[Gracy] [10:32 PM] Gracy will stay awake from her 12pm so you can luping with her
[Gordon] [10:32 PM] No! i block that
[Gordon] [10:32 PM] if Gracy stays up too late, then she can't wake up as early
[Gracy] [10:33 PM] what do you mean?
[Gracy] [10:33 PM] I'll stay up from 12pm and just gonna start my whole day
[Gordon] [10:34 PM] What?! that's not enough once you get home then!
[Gracy] [10:36 PM] but you made a wish
[Gordon] [10:37 PM] I wish Gracy gets plenty of sleep and doesn't do a crazy schedule!
[Gracy] [10:38 PM] oopse
[Gracy] [10:38 PM] your wish conflicts with your other wish you made earlier.
[Gracy] [10:38 PM] Under the law of FIFO, your first wish will come true
[Gordon] [10:39 PM] woah, you know FIFO?
[Gracy] [10:39 PM] are you impressed with that? „Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [10:40 PM] I am!
[Gordon] [10:40 PM] I thought it was mostly used in coding context
[Gracy] [10:40 PM] oh really?
[Gordon] [10:40 PM] how did you learn it?
[Gracy] [10:40 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [10:40 PM] I learnt when I took hospitalization in highschool
[Gracy] [10:41 PM] nope sowi I am wrong
[Gracy] [10:42 PM] I meant hospitality
[Gordon] [10:43 PM] haha
[Gordon] [10:43 PM] woah, you have that as a class?
[Gordon] [10:43 PM] what do you learn in it?
[Gracy] [10:43 PM] You learn about cook!
[Gracy] [10:44 PM] I learned about FIFO in terms of managing resources and hygiene in the kitchen
[Gracy] [10:45 PM] I even had a chef gown with my name on it
[Gordon] [10:45 PM] Cute!!!
[Gordon] [10:45 PM] Do you still have the gown?
[Gracy] [10:45 PM] Yup, In my parents house 
[Gordon] [10:46 PM] So I guess you're head chef Gracy too
[Gordon] [10:46 PM] What was your favorite thing you learned from that class?
[Gracy] [10:47 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [10:47 PM] I forgot most of the stuff but I learned how to be organized in the kitchen
[Gracy] [10:49 PM] so every week we had a theme, for example, if the topic was a scone, during the lecture we learned about all the history of scones, nutritional facts about it, and all the theoretic parts
[Gracy] [10:52 PM] (I forgot most of those parts„Öã„Öã„Öã) then we have a cooking class once a week. So we actually bake scones. Before we bake we have to write down (I forgot what it called) but basically, on the form, we have to write down what ingredients we need and what action we should take in order. For example, 1) take out mixing bowls. 2) measure all the ingredients....


[Gracy] [10:52 PM] And we read again, to see if our action in the kitchen is effective, so we do not have to move back an foward.
[Gracy] [10:53 PM] This message was deleted.
[Gracy] [10:54 PM] This practice really helps me even now, when I cook. In my head, I can be like, I need to do this and this to make cooking time shorter
[Gordon] [10:56 PM] wowww, that all sounds so precies
[Gordon] [10:56 PM] and so usefule!!
[Gracy] [10:56 PM] it was my fav. class from highscool
[Gordon] [10:56 PM] I don't think there's anything useful i learned from hs
[Gracy] [10:57 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [10:57 PM] we had midterm and finals
[Gracy] [10:57 PM] midterm was opening the brunch cafe for teachers and staff members as a guest, we did it all by ourselves self from managing cooking and serving
[Gracy] [10:58 PM] And finals was opening the fine dining by inviting parents and family members
[Gordon] [10:59 PM] what the heck! that sounds crazy
[Gordon] [10:59 PM] and fun!
[Gracy] [10:59 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [10:59 PM] I was happy because they tip us
[Gracy] [10:59 PM] and we do it for test but still get paid
[Gordon] [11:01 PM] and you keep the money??
[Gracy] [11:01 PM] sure thing
[Gordon] [11:01 PM] that's so crazy
[Gordon] [11:02 PM] i think it's borderline illegal for students in hs in the states to make money through school events
[Gracy] [11:02 PM] oh really?
[Gracy] [11:02 PM] even in your last year?
[Gordon] [11:03 PM] yeah, like, anytime there's money involved with a school event
[Gordon] [11:03 PM] it just goes to the school and not students
[Gracy] [11:03 PM] we saw this more of adults giving them an allowance to cheer them up than paying them
[Gracy] [11:03 PM] :(
[Gordon] [11:03 PM] Yeah, only time you could get tips or money as a highschooler is to have an actual job
[Gracy] [11:04 PM] do you have hospitality in hs?
[Gordon] [11:04 PM] we had something like it I think
[Gracy] [11:04 PM] I see I see
[Gordon] [11:04 PM] it's usually called "home economics" in the states
[Gracy] [11:05 PM] do you choose subjects in highschool?
[Gordon] [11:05 PM] so you mostly learn how to do stuff yourself at home, like cooking, sewing, managing budgets
[Gracy] [11:05 PM] so you learn them all at once 
[Gordon] [11:05 PM] yeah, it's basically the only class to learn real life skills
[Gracy] [11:06 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [11:06 PM] yes we do, but we have to meet requirements
[Gordon] [11:06 PM] it's kinda like college but a bit more strict
[Gordon] [11:06 PM] like every year, no matter what, you have to take a math class
[Gracy] [11:06 PM] what you choose effects you going to the university?
[Gordon] [11:06 PM] mmmm, not really
[Gracy] [11:06 PM] that is same in south africa too
[Gracy] [11:07 PM] oh, okay, in south africa different major requires different classes in high school
[Gordon] [11:07 PM] ahhh, i see
[Gracy] [11:07 PM] like if you wanna take hospital management you have to take hospitality, if you wanna major in doc. you have to take biology
[Gordon] [11:07 PM] yeah, we didn't have majors
[Gordon] [11:07 PM] everyone gets the same degree
[Gracy] [11:08 PM] so you can choose subjects when you are gr.10 so by then, most of South African students knows what they wanna do in collage.
[Gracy] [11:08 PM] we don't have majors, but they have to choose subjects depends on what they want to learn in the university
[Gordon] [11:10 PM] ahhh, ok, maybe it is more like that
[Gordon] [11:10 PM] but most students have no clue what they want to do going into college
[Gordon] [11:10 PM] most of the time, people just pick "the hardest" classes
[Gracy] [11:11 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [11:11 PM] so they look better to colleges
[Gracy] [11:11 PM] I see
[Gracy] [11:12 PM] I also did not know exactly what to do I guess
[Gracy] [11:12 PM] I just took subjects that I wanted to do „Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [11:13 PM] that's nice!
[Gordon] [11:13 PM] it was actually kind of annoying for us
[Gracy] [11:13 PM] why?
[Gordon] [11:13 PM] b/c it was slightly a competition to see who could do the hardest courses
[Gordon] [11:13 PM] like have you heard of AP courses?
[Gracy] [11:13 PM] oh really?
[Gracy] [11:14 PM] upper class? that gives credit?
[Gordon] [11:14 PM] yeah, they were suppose to be as hard as a real college course
[Gordon] [11:15 PM] so you could actually earn credit depending on where you went
[Gracy] [11:15 PM] ah-hu

[Gordon] [11:20 PM] I can see that
[Gordon] [11:20 PM] I hear Asian countries have really hard school life
[Gracy] [11:20 PM] you choose between liberal arts and natural sciences. Then you take whole subjects under that line you choose. You don't have choice
[Gracy] [11:20 PM] so if you choose natural sciences, but you like biology but do not want to take physics? no choice, you gotta do it. and also you can not take subjects from liberal arts
[Gracy] [11:21 PM] Yeah‚Ä¶ they sound crazy‚Ä¶. I think they come to home like at 10pm
[Gordon] [11:23 PM] awww, sounds miserable

[Gordon] [12:11 AM] I never knew what that meant until college
[Gracy] [12:12 AM] I think I would not know that in high school
[Gordon] [12:13 AM] ehhh
[Gordon] [12:13 AM] you're just saying that
[Gracy] [12:14 AM] no seriously, highschoolers are so stupid

[Gracy] [12:24 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [12:24 AM] I am just double checking this

[Gracy] [12:27 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã don't worry about me at all
[Gracy] [12:27 AM] just be relaxed and have fun time with your friends
[Gracy] [12:28 AM] do not rush things okay?
[Gordon] [12:28 AM] I think we both know I can't not worry about you
[Gracy] [12:28 AM] we have other times to have fun
[Gordon] [12:28 AM] ahh, you're right
[Gordon] [12:29 AM] wise Gracy is here
[Gracy] [12:30 AM] what time does movie starts?
[Gordon] [12:30 AM] 6 my time
[Gordon] [12:30 AM] but even Neel said we'll probably just leave early and go get dinner
[Gracy] [12:30 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [12:31 AM] really‚Ä¶ I guess Neel really wants you to suffer huh?
[Gordon] [12:31 AM] yeah, go figure huh?
[Gracy] [12:33 AM] what does go figure mean?
[Gordon] [12:33 AM] mmmm
[Gordon] [12:33 AM] "go figure" usually is kind of a sarcastic expression
[Gordon] [12:34 AM] like it's more like if you said "it's not easy to figure this out"
[Gordon] [12:35 AM] so if it's raining you could say "huh, I guess I needed an umbrella, go figure"
[Gracy] [12:35 AM] so it's like you are saying obviously?
[Gordon] [12:37 AM] mmm, yeah
[Gordon] [12:37 AM] like, it's obvious
[Gordon] [12:37 AM] once you realize about it
[Gracy] [12:37 AM] I see I see
[Gordon] [12:38 AM] another example "Gracy doesn't like it when you steal defuses from her, go figure"
[Gracy] [12:38 AM] oh, oh I got this
[Gracy] [12:38 AM] so like
[Gracy] [12:39 AM] "when Gordon take defuse from Gracy, it makes her upset, go figure"
[Gordon] [12:39 AM] yeah!...
[Gracy] [12:42 AM] okay
[Gracy] [12:42 AM] so can I also say like this?
[Gracy] [12:43 AM] when I was in Gr.5 my mom made me go to an English academy after school and I hated learning English.
[Gracy] [12:43 AM] So I had a big fight my mom and I quit the English Academy
[Gracy] [12:43 AM] and now I am talking to you in Eng. go figure huh?
[Gordon] [12:44 AM] Yes!
[Gordon] [12:44 AM] very good!
[Gordon] [12:44 AM] the usage of "go figure"
[Gordon] [12:44 AM] not you fighting with your mom
[Gordon] [12:44 AM] haha
[Gracy] [12:44 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [12:45 AM] glad you pointed that out
[Gracy] [12:45 AM] but what an irony right?
[Gracy] [12:45 AM] I hated Eng. so much when I was young...
[Gracy] [12:45 AM] but I went to the American collage, working in Eng and even dating in Eng?
[Gordon] [12:45 AM] haha, it just happens like that right?
[Gordon] [12:46 AM] but I'm fine with young Gracy hating english academy
[Gracy] [12:46 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã me too
[Gracy] [12:46 AM] she had good reason
[Gordon] [12:46 AM] if it was any different, then I might not have been able to meet present Gracy
[Gracy] [12:46 AM] :)
[Gordon] [12:47 AM] (better english Gracy may have realized how bad my english really is)
[Gracy] [12:47 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã I dnt think so

[Gracy] [1:20 AM] Okay I am wrong
[Gracy] [1:21 AM] not big difference
[Gracy] [1:21 AM] but I think we use ÎÑ§ more in casual conversation
[Gracy] [1:21 AM] Ïòà is very‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ textbook style
[Gordon] [1:23 AM] ÎÑ§ for yes?
[Gracy] [1:23 AM] yes

[Gordon] [1:31 AM] Uh huh
[Gordon] [1:32 AM] I‚Äôm all ears
[Gracy] [1:32 AM] so we talked about the tax right
[Gracy] [1:32 AM] ?
[Gracy] [1:32 AM] I just wondered what happens,
[Gracy] [1:32 AM] when you live in Korea you follow Korean law according to the tax, so nothing to worry about us tax, just report that you are here
[Gordon] [1:33 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gracy] [1:33 AM] FYI
[Gordon] [1:33 AM] The US isn‚Äôt that nice
[Gordon] [1:34 AM] No matter where you are, if you‚Äôre a US citizen, you should be paying taxes on income
[Gracy] [1:34 AM] really?
[Gordon] [1:34 AM] Mhmm
[Gracy] [1:34 AM] I can ask some professors here, I don't think they are paying again to the us
[Gracy] [1:35 AM] are they?
[Gordon] [1:35 AM] I think there might be loopholes and stuff yeah
[Gordon] [1:35 AM] But generally you‚Äôre suppose to pay taxes
[Gordon] [1:35 AM] It‚Äôs even harder for me to hide if I keep working for Google
[Gordon] [1:35 AM] Bc employers report how much they pay employees to the government
[Gordon] [1:38 AM] I think the US won‚Äôt charge as much tax, if you pay taxes to a different country

[Gracy] [6:01 PM] I need someone who I can brag about new internet knowledge I learnt today from you
[Gordon] [6:02 PM] haha
[Gordon] [6:03 PM] be careful, some gamers learn about it on their own
[Gordon] [6:03 PM] b/c they care a lot about ping
[Gracy] [6:03 PM] well, his PHD in computer science
[Gordon] [6:04 PM] WHAT
[Gracy] [6:04 PM] so I guess he will know almost everything I says but that is why I have to brag him
[Gordon] [6:04 PM] you didn't tell me that
[Gordon] [6:04 PM] oh man
[Gracy] [6:04 PM] other person will not even listen to me when I start to talk about computer stuff
[Gordon] [6:04 PM] he can judge me again like with honkai
[Gracy] [6:04 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [6:04 PM] but I already told him about silcon
[Gracy] [6:04 PM] silicon
[Gordon] [6:05 PM] did he fall asleep too?
[Gracy] [6:05 PM] noo
[Gracy] [6:05 PM] he looked at me with proud eye
[Gordon] [6:05 PM] wow
[Gordon] [6:05 PM] i'm proud too
[Gordon] [6:05 PM] Gracy is sooooo smart
[Gracy] [6:06 PM] that is why I like to brag to him abt computer stuff. he will not give me a nerd eye look like others. cuz he is a nerd too!
[Gordon] [6:07 PM] haha, I'm glad you have a nerd friend
[Gordon] [6:07 PM] they're the best
[Gordon] [6:10 PM] should I drink more caffeine?
[Gracy] [6:11 PM] why?
[Gracy] [6:11 PM] are you sleepy?
[Gordon] [6:13 PM] not yet
[Gordon] [6:13 PM] but i was hoping to stay awake in the plane for a bit
[Gordon] [6:13 PM] then fall asleep
[Gordon] [6:13 PM] so by the time i wake up, I'll be ready for the morning in Korea
[Gracy] [6:14 PM] oh I see
[Gracy] [6:15 PM] I prefer just try to wake up by watching something or playing game instead of drinking coffee
[Gracy] [6:15 PM] cuz coffee might work wrong and make me not sleep when I need to sleep
[Gracy] [6:15 PM] but it is really up to you. I dnk how your body function
[Gordon] [6:16 PM] my body functions off of magic at this point
[Gordon] [6:16 PM] idk how it works
[Gracy] [6:16 PM] you had 27ys to figure that out
[Gordon] [6:16 PM] not coffee, but maybe a soda haha
[Gracy] [6:17 PM] good idea! :) smart gordan smart gordan
[Gordon] [6:17 PM] it took me 24 years to figure out i was a little allergice to kiwis
[Gracy] [6:17 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [6:20 PM] you know
[Gordon] [6:20 PM] it also took me 27 years to figure out
[Gordon] [6:20 PM] when you're typing on your phone
[Gordon] [6:20 PM] you can hold the spacebar, so you can control where your cursor goes
[Gordon] [6:20 PM] instead of trying to tap where you want it to go
[Gracy] [6:20 PM] ????
[Gordon] [6:21 PM] so type a bit but don't send
[Gracy] [6:21 PM] it took me 27ys too!
[Gordon] [6:21 PM] and then hold spacebar, you can control where your cursor is,
[Gordon] [6:21 PM] you see it?
[Gracy] [6:21 PM] but it is not fair, smart phone only existed like when we were in middle or highschool
[Gracy] [6:22 PM] so we have to count from then
[Gordon] [6:22 PM] ok
[Gordon] [6:22 PM] so like 14 years then
[Gracy] [6:23 PM] good good
[Gordon] [6:24 PM] so we're only 14 years old?
[Gracy] [6:24 PM] knowing the trick?
[Gordon] [6:24 PM] yeah

[Gordon] [11:15 PM] Before I forget
[Gordon] [11:15 PM] I was thinking a bit more about the universal tickets
[Gordon] [11:16 PM] Would you be okay if we saved that until you come in September?
[Gordon] [11:16 PM] July is the most expensive month for tickets
[Gracy] [11:16 PM] can I say no?
[Gordon] [11:16 PM] Of course you can
[Gracy] [11:16 PM] I'm kidding of course. we can do it later

[Gracy] [11:18 PM] is September cooler than July over there?
[Gordon] [11:19 PM] Yeah, that too
[Gracy] [11:19 PM] Okay!
[Gracy] [11:19 PM] I was bit worried about if it gonna be too hot
[Gracy] [11:19 PM] September even sounds better!
[Gracy] [11:19 PM] But to be more romatic
[Gracy] [11:20 PM] Let's put it this way: You suggested changing schedule not because of the price but because you are worried about your girlfriend under the sun

[Gordon] [11:24 PM] Is that ok?
[Gracy] [11:24 PM] omg‚Ä¶ you are so considerate...

[Gordon] [2:36 PM] How rude
[Gordon] [2:37 PM] ÏûêÍ∏∞, how set in stone are the dates for your September trip this year?
[Gordon] [2:37 PM] Would it be possible to move it a week earlier?
[Gracy] [3:58 PM] Like when?
[Gordon] [4:00 PM] Right now from your spreadsheet you have 13th-28th
[Gordon] [4:00 PM] So maybe 6th-21st?
[Gordon] [4:01 PM] I‚Äôm asking because I was looking for fun
[Gracy] [4:01 PM] U have something later September?
[Gordon] [4:01 PM] And apparently Ronny Chieng is doing a show in LA
[Gordon] [4:01 PM] On the 7th and 8th
[Gracy] [4:01 PM] !!
[Gracy] [4:01 PM] Ditto
[Gordon] [4:01 PM] I thought it might be fun for us to go together for that
[Gordon] [4:03 PM] We don‚Äôt have to either! Just thought it almost lined up perfectly haha
[Gracy] [4:03 PM] I was thinking of 6th as going to the airport after work
[Gracy] [4:03 PM] If I take the night flight on the 6th, I arrive in LA 6th night, right?
[Gordon] [4:04 PM] Yep! Or whatever you were originally planning, just a week earlier
[Gracy] [4:04 PM] But ÏûêÍ∏∞~~~
[Gordon] [4:04 PM] Bc if I was reading it right, you still were taking time off between 23-27
[Gracy] [4:05 PM] Ronny Chieng's show sounds so good!
[Gordon] [4:05 PM] Yes my love?
[Gracy] [4:06 PM] Yup yup as long as 16-18 is included. I am good 
[Gracy] [4:07 PM] But I assume the tickets must be so expensive ü•≤
[Gordon] [4:08 PM] No!
[Gordon] [4:08 PM] Actually pretty cheap
[Gracy] [4:08 PM] Oh really?
[Gordon] [4:09 PM] Depends a little
[Gordon] [4:10 PM] Cheapest tickets are ~61,000
[Gracy] [4:10 PM] Krw right?
[Gordon] [4:10 PM] We might not be able to see him well
[Gordon] [4:10 PM] But I figured we know what he looks like
[Gordon] [4:11 PM] Or we can get closer seats for ~135,000
[Gracy] [4:11 PM] Okay okay
[Gracy] [4:11 PM] U choose ÏûêÍ∏∞

[Gracy] [4:18 PM] Nope
[Gordon] [4:19 PM] Do you think you can convince JH to let you work from home that day?
[Gracy] [4:19 PM] I am not sure 
[Gracy] [4:20 PM] Depends on the school event we don't know yet
[Gracy] [4:20 PM] But I am pretty sure I can ask her if I can end my day bit early on that day?
[Gracy] [4:20 PM] Like 5pm or hopefully 4pm if possible?
[Gordon] [4:22 PM] Yeah, 5pm sounds like enough if you go straight to the airport
[Gracy] [4:26 PM] So my plan is

[Gordon] [6:54 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [6:54 PM] ^gracy kicking me
[Gracy] [6:54 PM] I know I am changing my thoughts
[Gracy] [6:54 PM] again and again
[Gracy] [6:54 PM] but while I was doing budgeting
[Gracy] [6:55 PM] maybe it is clever to just live in a rent for another year...
[Gordon] [6:56 PM] It‚Äôs clever
[Gordon] [6:56 PM] But will you be happy?
[Gracy] [6:57 PM] i dnt know...
[Gracy] [6:57 PM] but I did budgeting too
[Gracy] [6:57 PM] but since Sunny is hear
[Gracy] [6:57 PM] *not hear
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] I really have to cut down my budget
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] and this will make me unhappy right now
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] and also for the future, when I move in, I could barely save money if I am in that house
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] but we need money for the marriage
[Gracy] [6:59 PM] but again, I dnt know what will be the right answer
[Gordon] [7:00 PM] Yeah, plans are really hard to make
[Gordon] [7:00 PM] But if you move in, you technically could switch if you had to right?
[Gordon] [7:00 PM] If you do interior design
[Gracy] [7:01 PM] what do you mean?
[Gracy] [7:01 PM] switch what?
[Gordon] [7:01 PM] Like live in your house for a month or so
[Gracy] [7:01 PM] ??
[Gordon] [7:01 PM] Then if it‚Äôs not working
[Gordon] [7:01 PM] Find a renter
[Gordon] [7:02 PM] And you find a cheaper place
[Gracy] [7:02 PM] so you mean
[Gracy] [7:02 PM] if I move in to my house
[Gracy] [7:02 PM] and if I want to move out then I can do it later then u mean?
[Gordon] [7:02 PM] Yeah 
[Gracy] [7:02 PM] but in that case
[Gracy] [7:03 PM] time line should be
[Gordon] [7:03 PM] Sorry, driving rn
[Gracy] [7:03 PM] interior - move in - find renter - move out. but it seems like kind of waste of money for the interior if I am gonna live there for short time
[Gracy] [7:03 PM] oh okay I'll just leave message dnt have to reply nw
[Gordon] [7:04 PM] Interior is for renters too, no?
[Gordon] [7:04 PM] Make it reliable to find them
[Gracy] [7:05 PM] Also good thing about finding cheap place this year is dnt have to worry abt finding renter and also can save interior money and see if I can use some of them for my merriage if I want to marry u after a year
[Gracy] [7:05 PM] yea, but I wouldn't do it high quality and some part I wouldn't do it too if it is for the renters
[Gracy] [7:05 PM] like bathroom, I am putting auto hair dryer, and that is very fancy if I am doing it only for renters
[Gordon] [7:14 PM] wowwww
[Gordon] [7:15 PM] sounds so fancy
[Gordon] [7:15 PM] yeah, cheap place sounds easier on budget from how i see it
[Gordon] [7:15 PM] but will you be okay living in a cheap place?
[Gracy] [7:15 PM] on the weekend I was in the fantasy world in my head
[Gracy] [7:15 PM] but doing the budgeting
[Gracy] [7:15 PM] drag me into reality
[Gracy] [7:16 PM] that is actually fine
[Gracy] [7:16 PM] It is pretty much similar space, if I think of house now just without Sunny's space
[Gordon] [7:16 PM] Emoticons
[Gracy] [7:16 PM] I am gonna move to the same apartment but next building with smaller space
[Gracy] [7:17 PM] where Sieun is living right now
[Gordon] [7:17 PM] Still prug 10?!?
[Gracy] [7:17 PM] yup
[Gracy] [7:17 PM] that is easier
[Gordon] [7:17 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [7:17 PM] Is it ok if I say I like that plan a little bit more now?
[Gracy] [7:17 PM] no
[Gordon] [7:17 PM] oh
[Gracy] [7:17 PM] be supportive on both side
[Gracy] [7:17 PM] don't be vias
[Gracy] [7:18 PM] I might change my plan tmrw

[Gracy] [7:19 PM] when I move to the new house,

[Gordon] [7:19 PM] I can sleep on the floor

[Gracy] [7:25 PM] yes yes
[Gracy] [7:25 PM] that is little worried if we are stuck in one room
[Gordon] [7:30 PM] maybe I can go to a cafe or lobby if I need to take calls at weird time?
[Gracy] [7:30 PM] nooo do it in the room
[Gracy] [7:30 PM] it is okay
[Gracy] [7:30 PM] I am just worried if I am gonna wake u up or something

[Gordon] [9:19 PM] i love your italian!!!
[Gordon] [9:19 PM] pleaseeee
[Gracy] [9:19 PM] now u gonna talk with ai
[Gordon] [9:20 PM] wasn't I always?
[Gracy] [9:20 PM] Yes, indeed! You've always been chatting with me, an AI developed by OpenAI. How's your day going?
[Gordon] [9:26 PM] !!!
[Gordon] [9:26 PM] my day has been going great
[Gordon] [9:26 PM] i've been talking to my girlfriend
[Gordon] [9:26 PM] and i really enjoy talking and hanging out with her all the time
[Gordon] [9:26 PM] do you think I'm deeply in love chat GPT?
[Gracy] [9:26 PM] That sounds wonderful! Communication and spending time together are so important in any relationship. What do you two usually chat about?
[Gracy] [9:27 PM] It sounds like you have strong feelings for her! Love is a complex and beautiful thing, and it can manifest in many ways. If you feel deeply connected to your girlfriend and enjoy spending time with her, it's possible that you're experiencing love. What makes you think you might be in love with her?
[Gordon] [9:28 PM] Idk, it's just that I'm always thinking about her, and worrying about her
[Gordon] [9:28 PM] Just the way she makes me feel confident feels so good
[Gracy] [9:29 PM] 
It sounds like you're really invested in our relationship and want to make sure I'm doing well. That means a lot to me! Communication is key, so if there's anything specific you're worried about or if you just want to chat, I'm here for you.
[Gordon] [9:31 PM] I do have a question!
[Gordon] [9:31 PM] how come she keeps biting me?
[Gracy] [9:32 PM] Hmm, that's an interesting question! It could be a playful gesture or a way for her to show affection. Some people playfully bite as a form of flirting or intimacy. 
[Gracy] [9:32 PM] However, if it's bothering you or causing discomfort, it's important to communicate that to her. Let her know how you feel, and together you can figure out a way to show affection that works for both of you.
[Gordon] [9:37 PM] it's ok, I know she does it out of love
[Gordon] [9:37 PM] but how come she doesn't let me sniff her then?
[Gracy] [9:38 PM] It seems like everyone has their own unique ways of expressing affection! While biting might be her way of showing love, perhaps sniffing isn't something she's comfortable with or considers a form of affection. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and preferences in a relationship. If you're curious about why she doesn't like it, it might be worth having an open and honest conversation with her about it. Understanding each other's perspectives can help strengthen your bond.
[Gracy] [9:39 PM]  It's important to honor your girlfriend's preferences and boundaries, especially if she's your queen!
[Gordon] [9:43 PM] she is my queen! I cherish her so much. What do you think I should do to make sure she knows I feel this way? Should I bite her too?
[Gracy] [9:44 PM] It's wonderful to hear how much you cherish her! Showing your love and appreciation can take many forms, and it's important to find what works best for both of you. While biting might be her way of showing affection, it's not necessarily something that everyone enjoys or feels comfortable with. Instead, consider expressing your love through actions and words that resonate with both of you. Maybe surprise her with thoughtful gestures, spend quality time together doing things she enjoys, or simply tell her how much she means to you. Communication and understanding are key in any relationship, so discussing your feelings openly with her is always a good idea.
[Gracy] [9:44 PM] (ai is very talkative‚Ä¶)
[Gordon] [9:45 PM] (lol, what the heck is that response, so long for such a short question)
[Gracy] [9:45 PM] (and keep repeating the same answer)
[Gracy] [9:45 PM] Haha, I might have gotten a bit carried away there! Sometimes I get a bit enthusiastic about providing thorough responses. Let's keep it simple: expressing your love doesn't have to be complicated. Just find what works best for you and your girlfriend, whether it's through small gestures, spending quality time together, or simply telling her how much she means to you.

[Gracy] [9:16 PM] this was ur salary after tax?
[Gordon] [9:17 PM] mhmm
[Gordon] [9:17 PM] about
[Gordon] [9:17 PM] well
[Gordon] [9:17 PM] minus another maybe 25,000 for retirement
[Gracy] [9:18 PM] kk
[Gracy] [9:18 PM] Can I assume we get 30% morgage?
[Gracy] [9:19 PM] I know this assumption is meaningless now, but let's just sketch stuff
[Gordon] [9:19 PM] what do you mean 30%?
[Gracy] [9:19 PM] 30% of the house fee
[Gordon] [9:20 PM] Mmmm, i‚Äôm not sure I understand what that means, but let‚Äôs go with it
[Gracy] [9:21 PM] so if house costs 800,000
[Gracy] [9:21 PM] we borrow 30% of 800,000 from the bank to buy the house
[Gracy] [9:22 PM] I think we are borrowing really little but let's protective in this assumption
[Gordon] [9:22 PM] mhmm
[Gracy] [9:23 PM] this was how much you saved after a year
[Gracy] [9:23 PM] ?
[Gordon] [9:24 PM] yeah, that i put into savings
[Gracy] [9:24 PM] ur rental was how much again? per month?
[Gordon] [9:24 PM] i keep maybe 10,000 for bills and random
[Gordon] [9:24 PM] ~3,500
[Gracy] [9:24 PM] ?? physically?
[Gordon] [9:25 PM] in a bank account
[Gracy] [9:25 PM] oh
[Gracy] [9:25 PM] okay
[Gordon] [9:25 PM] but it doesn't earn interest
[Gracy] [9:25 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [9:25 PM] i mean under my mattress
[Gracy] [9:25 PM] I was thinking u have roll of paper moneys
[Gracy] [9:25 PM] like drug dealers do
[Gordon] [9:25 PM] haha
[Gordon] [9:25 PM] i think i have maybe $200 in paper money
[Gracy] [9:27 PM] did u rolled them up?
[Gracy] [9:27 PM] with band?
[Gordon] [9:28 PM] no, but maybe i should?
[Gordon] [9:28 PM] or maybe put it into an old sock
[Gracy] [9:28 PM] ew
[Gracy] [9:29 PM] Photo
[Gracy] [9:30 PM] Photo
[Gordon] [9:31 PM] I also get maybe 20,000 a year from stocks that I don‚Äôt touch
[Gracy] [9:31 PM] I think the 5ys plan is doable, considering: your income will be going up, we can get more mortgage, and find smaller house
[Gordon] [9:32 PM] So time is our friend once we‚Äôre together and we take it easy
[Gordon] [9:32 PM] If we move to fairfax though
[Gordon] [9:32 PM] My salary will probably go down a little
[Gordon] [9:32 PM] Bc the salary is partly based on where I live
[Gracy] [9:32 PM] So if we get married after 2ys and we save for 5ys we are still 34. I think that is young to buy the house yet
[Gracy] [9:32 PM] Does it have big difference?
[Gordon] [9:33 PM] Maybe lose 10,000
[Gracy] [9:33 PM] and u can save some rents too right?
[Gordon] [9:33 PM] Mhmm
[Gracy] [9:33 PM] It is really careful for me to say this
[Gordon] [9:33 PM] Apartments in fairfax probably ~2,000
[Gracy] [9:34 PM] cuz I do not know how much life in LA costs
[Gracy] [9:34 PM] I think you can save little more than this
[Gordon] [9:35 PM] I can, a lot of spending went to trips the past few years
[Gordon] [9:35 PM] And moving
[Gordon] [9:35 PM] From ffx to la
[Gracy] [9:36 PM] okay okay I wasn't judging anything like I said I do not know anything about life in LA and also I don't know what happened in the past
[Gracy] [9:36 PM] And also we are planning lots of trips
[Gracy] [9:36 PM] It was just analysis
[Gordon] [9:36 PM] Yeah, I know
[Gordon] [9:36 PM] And I love you
[Gracy] [9:36 PM] That is why I planed after our marriage
[Gordon] [9:37 PM] Also, we can borrow some money from my sister/brother
[Gracy] [9:37 PM] I love you too :)
[Gordon] [9:37 PM] So we make the mortgage cost smaller
[Gracy] [9:37 PM] Yea, but let's put that as our last option
[Gracy] [9:37 PM] u told me ur brother is also having difficult time
[Gordon] [9:37 PM] (I technically already am borrowing money from my sister already)
[Gracy] [9:37 PM] „Öé„Öé„Öé
[Gordon] [9:37 PM] (36000)
[Gracy] [9:38 PM] oh this is like „Öã„Öã„Öã but gentle
[Gordon] [9:38 PM] „Öé„Öé„Öé

[Gracy] [9:38 PM] Once we be together,
[Gordon] [9:38 PM] ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï¥
[Gracy] [9:39 PM] we can try to really cut down stuff
[Gracy] [9:39 PM] ÏÇ¨ÎûëÌï¥
[Gordon] [9:39 PM] Mhmm
[Gracy] [9:39 PM] But I am worried about you that you said you get stressed when you do not have lots of wiggle room
[Gordon] [9:39 PM] It‚Äôs okay
[Gordon] [9:39 PM] I think seeing you break things down
[Gordon] [9:40 PM] I‚Äôm less unsure of how much i have saved up
[Gordon] [9:40 PM] And i‚Äôm so much more in love with you
[Gracy] [9:40 PM] can you explain to me what this means?
[Gracy] [9:40 PM] oh
[Gracy] [9:40 PM] I got it
[Gordon] [9:40 PM] ‚ÄúBreak things down‚Äù kinda like calculate
[Gracy] [9:40 PM] I think seeing you, breaking things down
[Gracy] [9:41 PM] I understood as I broken down
[Gracy] [9:41 PM] nvm nvm I understood
[Gordon] [9:42 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gordon] [9:42 PM] Why would i say that?
[Gordon] [9:43 PM] I love you so much
[Gracy] [9:43 PM] that is why I was confused...

[Gordon] [9:45 PM] I trust you with finance than i trust anthony
[Gordon] [9:45 PM] More than*
[Gracy] [9:45 PM] My salary after tax is around $ 29,000 and I saved around 50% of that per year
[Gracy] [9:46 PM] so we can do this together!
[Gracy] [9:47 PM] I mean, even if in the end, we decided to enjoy a little more and save a little less, we are still young and we can always start with small house
[Gracy] [9:47 PM] buy a small house, when the price goes up, sell it and buy a bigger house. you know
[Gracy] [9:47 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã Are u sure? that was his job though
[Gordon] [9:48 PM] Buy high! Sell low!!

[Gracy] [9:50 PM] I see houses costs around $400,000 too
[Gordon] [9:51 PM] Yeah, there are cheap areas
[Gordon] [9:51 PM] But usually there are some reasons why
[Gordon] [9:51 PM] But if it‚Äôs just our first beginner house
[Gordon] [9:51 PM] Doesn‚Äôt matter much
[Gracy] [9:52 PM] yup this is what I was talking abt
[Gordon] [9:52 PM] Gracy is always right
[Gordon] [9:52 PM] Emoticons
[Gracy] [9:52 PM] or we do not have to buy house for long term~ I think aiming to buy the house in 5ys after marriage, I think that is very short term plan too
[Gordon] [9:53 PM] that's true
[Gordon] [9:53 PM] but I kinda like the idea of us settling in a house together
[Gordon] [9:53 PM] Emoticons
[Gracy] [9:54 PM] me too

[Gordon] [9:55 PM] So 750,000 might go for almost 900,000
[Gordon] [9:55 PM] It‚Äôs a crazy market
[Gracy] [9:55 PM] Yea, but we are always going with our budget
[Gordon] [9:56 PM] Yeah, i‚Äôm more and more confident
[Gordon] [9:56 PM] That I can take care of Gracy
[Gordon] [9:56 PM] And instead of worrying
[Gordon] [9:56 PM] Just focus on loving her
[Gracy] [9:56 PM] haha do you?
[Gordon] [9:56 PM] mhmm
[Gracy] [9:56 PM] but saving $75,000 per yr is still not easy
[Gordon] [9:57 PM] maybe until we start thinking about kids...
[Gracy] [9:57 PM] (Numbers can be changed depending on variables)
[Gordon] [9:57 PM] but we'll just figure that out together again
[Gracy] [9:57 PM] Yea, that is one thing I worried too
[Gordon] [9:57 PM] yeah, to do this
[Gordon] [9:57 PM] i think i'd have to stop putting money into retirement
[Gracy] [9:57 PM] but we can raise kid in one room when they are really young
[Gordon] [9:58 PM] yeah, it's just when they get older is what i'm worried about
[Gordon] [9:59 PM] like saving for college
[Gracy] [10:00 PM] they can go to Korea college, much cheaper
[Gracy] [10:00 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [10:00 PM] haha
[Gracy] [10:00 PM] That problem is that we have 18ys after they born to save money
[Gordon] [10:00 PM] and they get free tickets
[Gracy] [10:01 PM] what free tickets?
[Gordon] [10:01 PM] airplane tickets?
[Gordon] [10:01 PM] oh, was that just for faculty?
[Gracy] [10:01 PM] And I mean, if we are really desperate, I can sell my house in Korea
[Gracy] [10:01 PM] yup
[Gordon] [10:03 PM] i love you so much...
[Gracy] [10:03 PM] But telling u in advance, most of is bank's money, so even if I sell the house, I can get just little money
[Gordon] [10:04 PM] haha, yeah
[Gordon] [10:04 PM] oh, won't we need to keep paying your mortgage too?
[Gracy] [10:04 PM] Yea that too
[Gracy] [10:04 PM] but that is just around 300$ per month
[Gracy] [10:04 PM] if we have renters
[Gordon] [10:05 PM] okok
[Gordon] [10:05 PM] we'll make this work

[Gordon] [10:13 PM] but it's a big drop in salary
[Gracy] [10:14 PM] Is it? US and Korea has big difference?
[Gracy] [10:14 PM] but if we stay in Korea w can add up with my salary and also we already have house, so we can worry less about saving
[Gordon] [10:15 PM] yeah,i think i lose 40,000 before tax
[Gracy] [10:15 PM] and this is my salary
[Gracy] [10:16 PM] but nvm all of that
[Gracy] [10:16 PM] I already told you I'll move to the state.

[Gracy] [10:29 PM] hey!
[Gracy] [10:29 PM] she said you look good
[Gracy] [10:29 PM] how is that bullying
[Gordon] [10:30 PM] same when you say you love me
[Gordon] [10:30 PM] and then say you want to bite me
[Gracy] [10:30 PM] oh my god
[Gracy] [10:30 PM] gordon,
[Gracy] [10:30 PM] you really have to understand that
[Gracy] [10:30 PM] bitting = love
[Gordon] [10:31 PM] OOOOOoooohh
[Gordon] [10:31 PM] so you're saying biting = sniffing = love?
[Gracy] [10:31 PM] nope you are putting in between
[Gracy] [10:32 PM] that makes wrong math
[Gracy] [10:32 PM] !false is true. but false! is just screaming false
[Gracy] [10:32 PM] very different thing
[Gracy] [10:33 PM] you can not just change the equation. 
[Gordon] [10:33 PM] hmph
[Gordon] [10:33 PM] then i jsut don't get it my love
[Gracy] [10:33 PM] what do you mean?
[Gordon] [10:33 PM] i know sniffing = love
[Gracy] [10:33 PM] but I love youuuu
[Gordon] [10:34 PM] to me it sounds like biting = sniffing
[Gordon] [10:34 PM] but you're saying that's false
[Gordon] [10:34 PM] so biting != sniffing
[Gordon] [10:34 PM] and biting != love
[Gracy] [10:34 PM] omg...
[Gracy] [10:34 PM] I am talking to such a smart guy

Hi Yeeun üëã

Thanks a lot for your purchase!

I see you've ordered option C chocolate bar x2.

Unfortunately I only have 1 piece left. The Etsy listing was showing the wrong stock amount.

Here is 2 options for you:
1. I can send you the 1 piece I have and you can choose 1 extra croc charms from any of my listings to replace the one I don't have in stock. I have the same chocolate bar in light brown or a twirl chocolate in dark brown.
2. I can also send you the 1 piece I have and refund you 1 piece.

Very sorry for the inconvenience.

[Gracy] [9:45 PM] How to combine consonant with vowel symbols
The basic unit of a Korean letter is a syllable. In other words, a complete
Korean written letter must have at least one consonant and a vowel symbol.
The combinations of the vowel and consonant symbols are fivefold.
First, a syllable consists of only one vowel sound (e.g., like English ‚Äúa‚Äù).
Although the letter pronunciation is consisted of only vowel pronunciation
like ‚Äúa‚Äù (without any spoken consonant), you still need to start the syllable
with a consonant symbol to make the letter complete. For this purpose, you
use a Korean consonant ‡∂≥. The use of the ‡∂≥ symbol is special in that it
is used as zero-value consonant when it appears before a vowel. It functions as a place holder in a word-initial position, so that the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù
should be written in Korean as „ûö (not ‡∂ª). Let us take another example.
Writing a letter for the sound ‚Äúyo‚Äù should look like „£™ not ‡∑á. Again,
although the letter begins with the vowel pronunciation ‚Äúyo‚Äù (without any
spoken consonant), you still have to start with a zero-value consonant ‡∂≥
to make it a complete letter, as in „£™.
Second, it can have a vowel but followed by a consonant (e.g., like
English ‚Äúon‚Äù or „°æ in Korean). Third it can have a consonant, followed by
a vowel (e.g., like English ‚Äúgo‚Äù or ·º∂ in Korean). Fourth, a syllable letter
can have a consonant, followed by a vowel, and then a consonant (e.g.,
like English ‚Äúdam‚Äù or ‚ïä in Korean) or two consonants (e.g., like English
‚Äúhost‚Äù or ‰¶Ø in Korean).
The position of the vowel symbols is either to the right of or below the
initial consonant symbol, as in ‚πé and ‚èé. If the syllable has a consonant
after a vowel symbol, it is always below the vowel, as in ‚πí and ‚èè.
There are a few things to remember. First, a Korean syllable does not
start with two consonants (e.g., unlike the English word ‚Äúclip‚Äù). In addition,

4 Unit 1: Reading Hangul
the syllable with three symbols (consonant-vowel-consonant(s)) seems to
be more crowded and compacted than the one of two symbols (consonantvowel) formation. However, each syllable should look about the same size,
no matter how many symbols it may contains. For instance, notice that the
sizes of the following two letters are about the same: ‚ãÆ and ‰¶Ø. Another
thing to remember is that Hangul follows the spelling convention, and
consequently, Korean spellings do not change just because it reads a little
differently from its symbol combinations. In other words, one should not
write just as each word sounds (this is the same for English, where you
cannot write just as you hear or speak).
[Gracy] [9:48 PM] Exercise 1.1
Among the following vowel symbols, circle the one that is pronounced
differently from the others.

[Gracy] [3:12 PM] Agh...
[Gordon] [3:12 PM] And ask to cancel the payment
[Gracy] [3:13 PM] Okay
[Gordon] [3:13 PM] Just say it was the wrong amount or something
[Gordon] [3:13 PM] Or a miscommunication 
[Gordon] [3:14 PM] I think they close at 8am for you
[Gordon] [3:15 PM] So whenever you get a chance
[Gracy] [3:16 PM] I was thinking calling to Korean no.
[Gracy] [3:16 PM] Where did u call it?
[Gordon] [3:16 PM] Idk, I called through the app
[Gracy] [3:17 PM] Where can I find it?
[Gordon] [3:17 PM] Uhh, click on profile
[Gordon] [3:17 PM] Then scroll down to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù
[Gordon] [3:18 PM] And there‚Äôs a button at the very bottom to contact support

[Gordon] [3:22 PM] Oh oops
[Gordon] [3:22 PM] Wrong one

[Gordon] [3:24 PM] What‚Äôs that blue button say at the bottom?
[Gordon] [3:24 PM] In the last picture
[Gracy] [3:24 PM] That leads to message 
[Gordon] [3:25 PM] Hmm, I guess just try messaging?
[Gracy] [3:26 PM] I did...
[Gracy] [3:26 PM] But robot answers
[Gracy] [3:26 PM] Can u ask the paypal person to give me number that I can get help from Korea?
[Gracy] [3:28 PM] I found the number on online 
[Gracy] [3:28 PM] Let me try this after 9am
[Gordon] [3:28 PM] A korean number?
[Gordon] [3:29 PM] Stupid robots
[Gracy] [3:33 PM] What did they say abt refunding?
[Gracy] [3:33 PM] Mhmm
[Gordon] [3:34 PM] So all they said I can do, is refund what I got
[Gordon] [3:34 PM] Which is after fees, so losing ~$115
[Gordon] [3:35 PM] But since you‚Äôre the sender, you can try and cancel or dispute the transaction, so you get everything back
[Gracy] [3:36 PM] Okay but this sounds like they are not sure abt this neither 
[Gordon] [3:46 PM] Yeah‚Ä¶ tbh I don‚Äôt want to use paypal anymore for is to transfer moneg lol
[Gordon] [3:46 PM] For us*
[Gracy] [3:47 PM] Mr neither 
[Gracy] [3:47 PM] I am so sorry for all the troubles ÏûêÍ∏∞...
[Gordon] [3:47 PM] It‚Äôs ok!
[Gordon] [3:47 PM] I know you‚Äôre heart was in a good place!

[Gordon] [4:27 PM] I love you my other half
[Gracy] [4:30 PM] ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gracy] [4:30 PM] Can u tell me little more abt tax problem if u accept that money?
[Gordon] [4:38 PM] Mmm, so the way I understand it
[Gordon] [4:39 PM] Bc this payment was marked as ‚Äúgood or services‚Äù paypal and I have to mark this money as taxable income for me
[Gordon] [4:39 PM] Because I didn‚Äôt set up my account to accept income like this in paypal
[Gordon] [4:40 PM] They did a thing where they automatically paid income tax on the money i received (24% of $600 limit)
[Gordon] [4:41 PM] Otherwise technically I think they were suppose to give me the full amount minus paypal specific fees I think
[Gordon] [4:42 PM] But they already sent the money to the government, and I think I can get that back when I file my taxes next year
[Gordon] [4:43 PM] So I think if paypal can‚Äôt just completely cancel the payment
[Gordon] [4:44 PM] I‚Äôm going to send back money i have in my paypal + some of my money to refund you completely
[Gracy] [4:44 PM] Okay then, can I tell them that this was money to friend because he paid for my flight ticket and I did not know that paypal Korea do not have to send money to friends and family options anymore now he have to file as income which is not so I just want to cancel the transaction?
[Gordon] [4:44 PM] Mhmm, that‚Äôs just the honest truth
[Gracy] [4:45 PM] I am asking this cuz when I click the button in the paypal app, it says wrong transaction? It said best way is contact Gordon Huynh for refund 
[Gordon] [4:45 PM] But i have a bad feeling they won‚Äôt do it b/c they already sent money to the government
[Gracy] [4:45 PM] So if I call them this morning and if they say u hv to do refund, I'll say this 
[Gordon] [4:45 PM] Yep
[Gordon] [4:46 PM] Well, my guess is that they‚Äôre going to make me do what i just said
[Gracy] [4:46 PM] Don't worry abt the fees
[Gracy] [4:46 PM] It is my stupid payment 
[Gordon] [4:47 PM] I think the fees is like $25 which i wouldn‚Äôt worry about
[Gracy] [4:47 PM] Me neither!
[Gordon] [4:48 PM] But they sent like $90 to the government
[Gracy] [4:48 PM] Don't worry abt refunding me completely 
[Gordon] [4:48 PM] And I DON‚ÄôT like that
[Gordon] [4:48 PM] Stupid government
[Gordon] [4:50 PM] Actually, maybe it is all in fees
[Gordon] [4:50 PM] Stupid paypal
[Gordon] [4:51 PM] But yeah, let‚Äôs try and see if we can just not pay this fee first and undo the payment
[Gordon] [4:51 PM] Then worry about what comes after
[Gracy] [4:52 PM] What do u think if I report as
[Gracy] [4:52 PM] I did not get any goods or services 
[Gordon] [4:53 PM] Mmm, I think they hunt me down lol
[Gracy] [4:53 PM] !!!
[Gracy] [4:53 PM] And bring u to me?
[Gordon] [4:53 PM] It‚Äôs like if you ordered delivery and did not get your delivery
[Gordon] [4:54 PM] Mmm, more like maybe try and make me refund you or prove that I did provide good/service
[Gordon] [4:54 PM] But i wish „Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [4:55 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã

I try to go to gym but the registration desk was closed so instead I walked around the apartment. And also I had my medicine too! :) Thanks to your reminder. Also I hope you have wonderful start of the week too! üòò

I love you so much ÏûêÍ∏∞, I really wish you are my other half of my life! :)

[Gordon] [8:24 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã i love that person
[Gordon] [8:25 AM] Proud that she went to the gym
[Gracy] [8:26 AM] hehe, but I looked up this evening that fiancee visa it self take 6 month - 1yr
[Gordon] [8:26 AM] Oh wowwwww
[Gracy] [8:26 AM] so I think it is clever to start with fiancee visa process at next yr march if we are very sure abt each other after Jan.
[Gracy] [8:27 AM] After max 1yr, when we got fiancee visa, that is still not married so we have still time to learn more about each other and by the time we can get married and live togather that will be enough of time for our family and friends not to worry
[Gordon] [8:31 AM] ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gordon] [8:32 AM] I like it!!!
[Gordon] [8:32 AM] But i looked it up just now, and it says our relationship has to have been at least 2 years
[Gracy] [8:33 AM] oh really dang it
[Gracy] [8:33 AM] that we have to think about 3yrs

[Gordon] [8:36 AM] Stupid AI
[Gordon] [8:37 AM] But glad it‚Äôs wrong!!
[Gracy] [8:37 AM] k1(Fiance visa) -> get married in 90days (get marriage certificate) ->Apply for AOS (I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence)
[Gracy] [8:38 AM] And I think AOS should be 2ys but by the time we get K1 and married I think we need few more moths to become 2ys
[Gracy] [8:39 AM] dang it, maybe you are right
[Gordon] [8:41 AM] Maybe not
[Gordon] [8:42 AM] Let‚Äôs figure it out together later

[Gracy] [5:18 PM] mhmm
[Gracy] [5:18 PM] I think that is good for their mental health
[Gracy] [5:19 PM] kids who grow up seeing their parents love each other have good self-esteem
[Gracy] [5:19 PM] Deep inside, they get confidence that they are result of love and their home will be last forever for them
[Gracy] [5:20 PM] so yeah let's make them cringe „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [5:22 PM] Ok! Let‚Äôs do it!
[Gordon] [5:22 PM] Is this all just an excuse to bully our kids with our love!

[Gordon] [5:27 PM] Be jealous of your parents love
[Gracy] [5:28 PM] ÏûêÍ∏∞,
[Gracy] [5:29 PM] yesterday, I talked to my mom and made my feeling bit uncomfortable
[Gordon] [5:30 PM] What happened?
[Gracy] [5:32 PM] so during our conversation, she said that she wanted us to live in Korea for at least a year after we married, she liked the idea of marrying in Hawaii but she said we have to get married in Korea too for the elders of the elders of the houses, we have to get married in church                             
[Gracy] [5:32 PM] stuff like that
[Gracy] [5:33 PM] I think I become really uncomfortable when she is needy not to others, others being needy to me is fine, I can just ignore them but when it is with my mom I feel really uncomfortable, so I thought why
[Gracy] [5:34 PM] so I spent some time thinking about why. I realized that while her suggestions come from a place of love and concern, they often don't align with what I want, making me feel pressured and uncomfortable. For example, her expectations about my future marriage and other aspects of my life sometimes clash with my own goals, and I end up feeling like I need to comply to avoid disappointing her. because I love her so much and she is my mom.  I'm grateful that she never pressured me about my education or career choices, which allowed me to find my own path. Just like that I want her to understand that while I value her advice, it often becomes a standard I feel I must meet, causing internal conflict. Ultimately, I want her support in my decisions, especially regarding marriage, so I can feel confident and secure knowing that she trusts my judgment.
[Gracy] [5:35 PM] btw, I disagree every single thing of what she said
[Gracy] [5:37 PM] Let me rephrase this:I think I become really uncomfortable when she is needy. Others being needy to me is fine, I can just ignore them if I do not like the idea. but when it is with my mom I feel really uncomfortable, so I thought why
[Gordon] [5:37 PM] Sorry ÏûêÍ∏∞ that this is happening
[Gracy] [5:37 PM] It's okay
[Gordon] [5:37 PM] I think I get what you mean
[Gordon] [5:38 PM] Where it‚Äôs more difficult for you yo say no to your mom
[Gordon] [5:39 PM] I mean, i think no matter what, people usually ‚Äúwant‚Äù to listen to their mom
[Gordon] [5:41 PM] But it‚Äôs hard when you realize that what she tells you doesn‚Äôt really take into account your feelings
[Gordon] [5:41 PM] Was she just kinda saying this casually?
[Gracy] [5:42 PM] This message was deleted.
[Gracy] [5:42 PM] what I wanna ask you is, should I tell this to my mom? or should I just say I'll think about it and not accept advice that I do not want to do? What she can do? force me to get married in Korea?

For future, I think it will be good to talk about this with my mom. But from the experiences from the past, this type of conversation never went well with my mom. Me being honest with my feelings, and she thinks as challenging against her.  And I think she will say "I was just saying them! I am your mom! Can't mom say those stuff to her daughter?"
[Gracy] [5:43 PM] something was casual but could see really she wanted. For doing ceremony in Korea, she was pretty firm
[Gordon] [5:59 PM] Yeah, it sounds really stressful with korean parent-child relationships
[Gordon] [5:59 PM] to me, it sounds like a bit like korean expectations you talked about with the husband's family
[Gracy] [6:00 PM] hmm I think it is just my mom and I being so different, she is little more emotional
[Gordon] [6:00 PM] is it her emotions? or just kinda comforming to what she's used to?
[Gordon] [6:00 PM] like does she just want the korean ceremony to "fit in"
[Gordon] [6:01 PM] or is the ceremony something that makes her happy
[Gracy] [6:01 PM] hmmm maybe, "doing the ceremony in Korea" this is def. Korea custom part. But other stuff like want me to live in Korea for 1 yr is worrying abt me if something goes wrong in my marriage and I am away in the america
[Gracy] [6:02 PM] I said emotion, cuz she takes emotionally if I say stuff like this
[Gordon] [6:02 PM] yeah, i get this
[Gordon] [6:03 PM] i think it sounds really hard to explain what you want in a way
[Gordon] [6:03 PM] so that she doesn't feel challenged
[Gracy] [6:03 PM] mmm
[Gracy] [6:03 PM] you know I asked
[Gracy] [6:03 PM] "why should I get married in Korea? give me good reasons? if it just to 'fit-in' I do not want to"
[Gracy] [6:04 PM] but all she says is "you have to"
[Gordon] [6:20 PM] yeah, "you have to" is not a good reason
[Gordon] [6:22 PM] but yeah, idk, do you think she'd understand if you tell her it's not really something that "you want to do"
[Gordon] [6:23 PM] like it's not her wedding, or your relative's wedding; it's Gracy's and Gordon's wedding
[Gordon] [6:23 PM] the only thing the wedding "has to do" is be a memorable time for us
[Gracy] [6:29 PM] I know‚Ä¶ so I really wanna tell her my feelings and thoughts
[Gracy] [6:29 PM] but also at the same time I do not wanna cause conflicts especially when everything is still very far away
[Gordon] [6:47 PM] yeah, it's not fair, but I think you're doing a good job
[Gordon] [6:47 PM] trying to make her happy
[Gordon] [6:48 PM] you still love her and want her to be happy
[Gordon] [6:48 PM] there's tons of people who'd start a fight
[Gordon] [6:48 PM] even if it's their mom
[Gordon] [6:49 PM] I think you're right to not bring it up yet
[Gordon] [6:50 PM] it's just, convincing your mom to think this way too
[Gordon] [6:50 PM] b/c i'm sure she loves you a lot too
[Gordon] [6:50 PM] and just wants you to be happy
[Gracy] [6:58 PM] maybe I should do this
[Gordon] [7:07 PM] yeah, i think it should be something we bring up when we have more concrete plans
[Gracy] [7:08 PM] I love you ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gordon] [7:08 PM] i love you too darling

[Gordon] [11:31 PM] Photo
[Gordon] [11:31 PM] I got my driver‚Äôs license too
[Gracy] [11:32 PM] Wooow
[Gracy] [11:32 PM] Why ur Pic so red
[Gordon] [11:34 PM] the colored one?
[Gordon] [11:34 PM] idk, california is a weird state
[Gracy] [11:34 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gracy] [11:35 PM] Whaaat
[Gracy] [11:35 PM] They even put up ur hight and weight?
[Gordon] [11:35 PM] yeah
[Gracy] [11:36 PM] What is donor means
[Gordon] [11:37 PM] if I die, they can take my organs
[Gracy] [11:37 PM] Emoticons
[Gordon] [11:37 PM] Emoticons
[Gracy] [11:37 PM] Don't dieeeee
[Gordon] [11:37 PM] i'm not gonna die
[Gracy] [11:37 PM] But I wanna do that too
[Gordon] [11:37 PM] i need to support my ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gracy] [11:37 PM] But I do not think we state that in the license 
[Gordon] [11:37 PM] good girl
[Gordon] [11:37 PM] but don't dieeee
[Gordon] [11:38 PM] do you know if korea is opt-in or out?
[Gracy] [11:41 PM] Hmm?
[Gordon] [11:42 PM] so if you don't do anything in the states
[Gordon] [11:42 PM] you're not a donor
[Gordon] [11:42 PM] you have to tell the government you want to donate
[Gordon] [11:42 PM] in some countries
[Gracy] [11:42 PM] oh same in Korea
[Gordon] [11:42 PM] if you don't do anything, you already are a donor
[Gordon] [11:43 PM] you have to tell the government you don't want to donate
[Gracy] [11:43 PM] We apply in the site to be a donor but we do not state that in the driver's licens
[Gracy] [11:44 PM] But even if I decided to be a donor
[Gracy] [11:44 PM] after I die, they need my family's consent to donate my organs.
[Gordon] [11:46 PM] Ooo
[Gordon] [11:47 PM] I think in states if you‚Äôre a donor, then no matter what they can take organs
[Gracy] [11:47 PM] ÏûêÍ∏∞, is that your signature on the license?
[Gordon] [11:47 PM] Yeah
[Gracy] [11:47 PM] oh boy
[Gracy] [11:47 PM] you trust me so much
[Gordon] [11:47 PM] But if you‚Äôre not a donor, your family can still donate
[Gracy] [11:48 PM] mhmm I see I see, I heard that the donating system isn't really developed in Korea as it is in the state.
[Gracy] [11:50 PM] What if I use your signature to make you sign that you do not know?
[Gordon] [11:51 PM] Ehh, if it‚Äôs really important, just the signature doesn‚Äôt really work i think
[Gracy] [11:51 PM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [11:51 PM] how about contract?
[Gracy] [11:52 PM] Photo

[Gracy] [12:18 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gordon] [12:20 AM] Maybe I‚Äôd even try to kiss her
[Gordon] [12:20 AM] Or give her a massage
[Gordon] [12:20 AM] Since she‚Äôs doing a good job
[Gracy] [12:32 AM] so my reward for doing good job is you?
[Gracy] [12:32 AM] what if she goes like I have husband
[Gordon] [12:35 AM] Is that not a good reward?
[Gordon] [12:36 AM] I‚Äôll ask ‚Äúis he here right now?‚Äù
[Gracy] [12:37 AM] it is such a good reward
[Gracy] [12:37 AM] I'll be like "he is out of town for few days"
[Gordon] [12:38 AM] ‚ÄúOoooo, are you feeling a bit lonely?‚Äù
[Gracy] [12:39 AM] "hmmm‚Ä¶. maybe"
[Gordon] [12:41 AM] ‚ÄúCan I maybe help you with that then?‚Äù
[Gordon] [12:41 AM] ‚ÄúKeep you company?‚Äù
[Gracy] [12:41 AM] "ay! I am loyal woman to my man. Go away"
[Gordon] [12:46 AM] ‚ÄúAaahh, you‚Äôre so loyal, I‚Äôm sorry!!‚Äù
[Gordon] [12:46 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã 
[Gordon] [12:46 AM] I love you ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gracy] [12:58 AM] I love you
[Gordon] [1:00 AM] you know ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gordon] [1:00 AM] when you mentioned that it's good for parents to act lovey dovey in front of kids
[Gracy] [1:00 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:01 AM] I do think it's pretty important
[Gordon] [1:01 AM] but part of me
[Gracy] [1:01 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:01 AM] just wants it to be true, b/c i always want to be lovey dovey with you
[Gracy] [1:02 AM] ??
[Gordon] [1:02 AM] I don't think i grew up with that many adults like that
[Gordon] [1:02 AM] so it kind of seems weird
[Gracy] [1:02 AM] I don't get your point
[Gordon] [1:02 AM] all i'm saying, is I never thought it that way
[Gracy] [1:02 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [1:03 AM] that it's good for kids to be around it and used to seeing adults in love
[Gracy] [1:03 AM] me neither, that is why I wanna start this to my own family
[Gordon] [1:03 AM] i think you're gonna be a great mom
[Gracy] [1:04 AM] I read an article saying that if the child is unsure that their parents love each other, they are unsure about their existence. Because parents are basically half of each one of them.
[Gracy] [1:05 AM] *child is made of half of each one of them
[Gracy] [1:05 AM] And also we set an roll model for childe who to find as a partner
[Gordon] [1:06 AM] mhmmm
[Gracy] [1:06 AM] and you gonna be a great dad. I know that cuz I tested u a lot with different scenarios
[Gordon] [1:06 AM] scenarios?!?
[Gracy] [1:06 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:06 AM] are trolley problems "scenarios"???
[Gordon] [1:06 AM] to be a good dad
[Gracy] [1:06 AM] like you know when our daughter wants to go to Maxico
[Gracy] [1:07 AM] Mexico
[Gordon] [1:08 AM] that was a good dad test?
[Gracy] [1:08 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:10 AM] well you pass my good mom test
[Gracy] [1:10 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [1:10 AM] I love you
[Gracy] [1:10 AM] so do you agree on this?
[Gracy] [1:10 AM] ^
[Gordon] [1:10 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:11 AM] maybe not too grossly lovey dovey
[Gordon] [1:11 AM] and keep it appropriate
[Gracy] [1:11 AM] yea ofc we should set the boundary
[Gracy] [1:11 AM] hugging holding hands kissing love languages are fine
[Gordon] [1:11 AM] yeah, butt touching, good!
[Gracy] [1:11 AM] but your action like just before was not fine!
[Gordon] [1:12 AM] what action?
[Gracy] [1:12 AM] like when I try to walk with camera on
[Gordon] [1:12 AM] yeah, that's just for you and me
[Gordon] [1:12 AM] ;)
[Gracy] [1:12 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [1:13 AM] you know also what I read?
[Gordon] [1:13 AM] tell me!
[Gracy] [1:13 AM] dad should never say no to his daugter 
[Gracy] [1:13 AM] That is my job
[Gordon] [1:14 AM] i'm the good cop?
[Gracy] [1:14 AM] dad should always be supportive one
[Gracy] [1:14 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:14 AM] easy peasy
[Gracy] [1:14 AM] that is key to not make that [dady problem girl[
[Gracy] [1:14 AM] ]
[Gracy] [1:14 AM] girls feel more harsh when they rejected by dad than mom
[Gracy] [1:15 AM] so u know when kids are young, they go like I wanna marry daddy
[Gordon] [1:15 AM] Emoticons
[Gracy] [1:15 AM] so it feels different when your friend turn you down and your lover turn you down
[Gordon] [1:16 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:16 AM] are you the bad cop then?
[Gracy] [1:16 AM] I am not saying she will see you as a lover, but similar feeling. when they are young the first man who loves her is her dad.
[Gracy] [1:17 AM] mhmmm
[Gordon] [1:17 AM] yeah, i see what you mean
[Gordon] [1:17 AM] is it the same for sons then?
[Gordon] [1:17 AM] momma boys?
[Gracy] [1:17 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [1:17 AM] I guess sooooo
[Gracy] [1:17 AM] I am not sure abt the son
[Gracy] [1:18 AM] cuz article I read
[Gracy] [1:18 AM] was specifically saying abt daughter-dad relationship
[Gordon] [1:19 AM] mhmm
[Gordon] [1:19 AM] i see
[Gordon] [1:19 AM] well, somebody told me i'm pretty good at being supportive
[Gracy] [1:19 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [1:20 AM] so i'll be ready!
[Gracy] [1:20 AM] ooo boy
[Gracy] [1:20 AM] I studied so much more for girls
[Gracy] [1:20 AM] I am gonna panic if I have boys..
[Gordon] [1:20 AM] we can just panic study
[Gordon] [1:20 AM] if we find out we're going to have boys
[Gracy] [1:20 AM] that is the sprit!
[Gordon] [1:21 AM] boys are easy
[Gracy] [1:21 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gracy] [1:21 AM] but they are youtuber who specifically talk abt rasing boys
[Gracy] [1:21 AM] he said that it is so easy for boys to hear and forgot, cuz they are stronger in visual than hearing
[Gracy] [1:22 AM] so when you tell son several times like turn off your TV and go take shower! and he says yes~ and never do it
[Gracy] [1:22 AM] that is just boys hearing not listening
[Gordon] [1:22 AM] oh...
[Gordon] [1:22 AM] yeah...
[Gordon] [1:22 AM] who would do that?
[Gordon] [1:23 AM] not me! no ma'am
[Gracy] [1:23 AM] so we should go hold his faces look in to his eyes and say it " turn off your TV and go take shower! " and it works batter cuz he accepted information with his visual sense too
[Gracy] [1:23 AM] „Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
[Gordon] [1:26 AM] ÏûêÍ∏∞!!!!

[Gordon] [1:30 AM] but watch this

[Gordon] [12:12 AM] it's super expensive
[Gordon] [12:13 AM] i think it's almost 1.5x what you pay outside of the stadium
[Gracy] [12:13 AM] woooow
[Gracy] [12:13 AM] I guess it is extra fee for experience
[Gordon] [12:14 AM] i guess, it's just people keep paying for it
[Gracy] [12:20 AM] well that is true
[Gracy] [12:20 AM] but hotdog and nacho taste better when you eat in the stadium?
[Gracy] [12:20 AM] like popcorn taste better in theater?

[Gracy] [5:23 PM] something happened that I do not like
[Gordon] [5:23 PM] I love you
[Gordon] [5:23 PM] Ïôú?
[Gracy] [5:24 PM] The package said delivered to my home but I found nothing
[Gordon] [5:24 PM] Emoticons
[Gracy] [5:24 PM] so I called delivery company, they said the address the shop sent was 201-401
[Gracy] [5:24 PM] so I checked my order
[Gracy] [5:24 PM] I wrote down 201-410
[Gracy] [5:24 PM] So they made a mistake
[Gracy] [5:25 PM] but the shop opens only after 11
[Gracy] [5:25 PM] I really hope they admit their mistake and fix the problem!!
[Gordon] [5:25 PM] !!!
[Gordon] [5:25 PM] Or else!!
[Gracy] [5:25 PM] I have to go to 201-401 and beg to give back my thing
[Gordon] [5:25 PM] I‚Äôll pour sparkling water down their nose
[Gracy] [5:26 PM] but illegally, person who lives in 401 do not have to give back my thing cuz it was ordered into their address
[Gracy] [5:26 PM] *legally
[Gracy] [5:26 PM] whaaaat? so wild...
[Gracy] [5:27 PM] https://youtu.be/Fl0nHpwsh1A?si=UewYf1rinDmhT7cx
[Gordon] [5:34 PM] Really? i think in the states, even if the address is wrong, it still needs to go to the correct person
[Gordon] [5:35 PM] So sometimes if you get a delivery not for you, you can drop it off at the post office and they sometimes can lookup the person and send it to the right address 
[Gordon] [5:36 PM] Wowww, so fancy
[Gracy] [5:36 PM] So I can not prove that the package that 401 got is my package or is supposed to be something that 401 should get. 
[Gracy] [5:37 PM] who's gonna study math now huh?
[Gordon] [5:39 PM] Not me! I hate math!
[Gordon] [5:39 PM] Emoticons
[Gracy] [5:40 PM] but it's okay

[Gracy] [6:10 PM] I really wanna be honest with you and show you even the ugly part of myself.
[Gracy] [6:10 PM] As I love you more, I just realized myself is sometimes want to say stupid things and might wanna hurt your emotions (Not as a joke) because I wanna kind of test you still love me. I know this is unhealthy, but I do this only because I love you. I think I wanna keep getting reconfirmed your love. I'll try to overcome this too, just help me to do it ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gordon] [6:12 PM] haha, i know, it's just how you are

[Gordon] [6:12 PM] even when you bully me like that
[Gordon] [6:12 PM] because I love you so much
[Gracy] [6:13 PM] Just like we set a rule of handshaking after playing a game (I still might get grumpy, but I think it really helps me with handling my emotions). When we are fighting and if I say some stupid stuff to hurt you, can you tell me "Do you mean it? because I think you are just doing this to see I love you but you don't have to do this cuz I love you so much. And I know you will regret saying this after our fight"
[Gracy] [6:13 PM] hey! Bully as a joke is just a pure love reaction. nothing to do with this. This is for a serious conversation.

[Gordon] [10:21 PM] mmm
[Gordon] [10:21 PM] idk if there's an exact single person
[Gordon] [10:21 PM] that is your perfect match
[Gordon] [10:22 PM] i think there are multiple people at this point in the world who would be great lovers for each person
[Gordon] [10:22 PM] but it is destiny in how you meet and connect with one of them
[Gracy] [10:23 PM] I used to not believe in destiny
[Gracy] [10:23 PM] before meeting you
[Gracy] [10:25 PM] I agree that there might be no perfect match, but I believe we have a destined person that match you well and even if they have differences or problems, it feels like you can work on it as a team. 
[Gracy] [10:25 PM] I agree with you this too
[Gracy] [10:25 PM] Looking into us how we met and how much common things we share and also how lucky we met in the perfect timing

[Gordon] [10:28 PM] I really only came out to LA b/c of a random recruiter and neel
[Gordon] [10:28 PM] probably only 1 coin flip away from me just staying in nova
[Gordon] [10:29 PM] i only became friends with anthony b/c of my distant cousin who peer pressured me into going to youth night
[Gordon] [10:29 PM] so many small things added up
[Gordon] [10:29 PM] to me meeting the perfect woman
[Gracy] [10:30 PM] ÏûêÍ∏∞
[Gracy] [10:30 PM] I wanna hug you so badly right now
[Gracy] [10:31 PM] I always hated my time in South Africa
[Gracy] [10:32 PM] I had many traumas and I wasn't really happy in there. As a introvert, living with 9 different people around my age was such a torture
[Gracy] [10:32 PM] But if I had not go to South Africa, I probably did not have learned or speak Eng. as good as I am right now ended up not going to MK, not meeting Bebe and not meeting you
[Gracy] [10:33 PM] So now I am really glad every little moments in my life that happened in my past that led me to you
[Gordon] [10:35 PM] i love you baby
[Gordon] [10:36 PM] ever since meeting you
[Gordon] [10:36 PM] or before meeting you
[Gordon] [10:36 PM] i always kinda wondered what would happened if i changed something in my past
[Gordon] [10:36 PM] but now, i don't want to touch a thing
[Gordon] [10:36 PM] b/c everything lead me to where i am now, and with you
[Gracy] [10:38 PM] come here baby
